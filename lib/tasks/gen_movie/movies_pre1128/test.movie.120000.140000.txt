In June 1950, Bawulgol was a small and peaceful village in South Korea; while North and South Korea were at war, the fighting had yet to spread to the town and most of the residents didn't think much about it over the course of a day. That changes one day when American forces arrive and order the people of Bawulgol to leave, warning them that an escalation in fighting will likely mean a strike on the village in the near future. The citizens of Bawulgol dutifully pack up and leave, but the evacuation effort doesn't go as planned, and when they approach a bridge in nearby No Gun Ri, they're attacked by American troops who believe they're affiliated with the North Koreans. The No Gun Ri Massacre has been a matter of passionate debate among historians of the Korean Conflict; for years, the United State denied any attack took place, and though research decades later confirmed the incident did happen, some American sources claim no more than a handful of people were killed, while Korean authorities contend as many as three hundred South Korean civilians lost their lives.

After the floodwaters subsided, Mrs. Parker was the first resident to return to her now flood-devastated community with what many thought was the \"impossible dream\" of bringing her ruined home back to life. I'm Carolyn Parker: The Good, the Mad, and the Beautiful unfolds as an inspiring portrait of an extraordinary woman. Mrs. Parker takes us deep inside her personal biography as a child born in the 40's, raised in segregated New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, who became a teen-ager joining the front lines in the Civil Rights movement of the 60's, who worked for thirty years as a cook-turned-chef in the hotel industry, and became one of the most outspoken voices in the fight for every New Orleanian's right to return home after the devastation of the floods that followed Katrina. That Carolyn faced these odds with unbridled wit, spirituality and an abiding sense of social justice borne of her life in New Orleans makes for a unique cinematic tale of personal triumph.

When Baz is murdered, the family's voice of reason is gone, and the unstable Pope takes the lead in the family's hierarchy; as suspicions fall on Joshua, the quiet newcomer is moved out of the house to keep him safe. Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) is a police detective who has found out who Joshua is and what he knows, and he tries to convince the teenager to help him put the Cody family behind bars, though Joshua isn't certain about his loyalties to these outlaws who are also his blood.

Sarah \"Saartjie\" Baartma (Yahima Torres) was born in South Africa but found a certain fame in Europe in the first decades of the 19th century, as she was exhibited like a sideshow attraction by Hendrick Caezar (Andre Jacobs), who billed her as \"The Hottentot Venus\" and encouraged audiences to view her as part human, part animal. Baartma performed like a trained animal under Caezar's direction, and sometimes she was required to appear nude before the crowds as spectators were allowed to touch her buttocks and genitals. When reporters condemn Caezar's exploitation of Baartma, she declares in court that she's acting of her own free will, but she's hesitant to explain why she allows herself to be treated so poorly. When Baartma's partnership with Caezar comes to an end, she finds herself working with a French showman, Reaux (Olivier Gourmet), who is even less scrupulous as he parades her before slumming French aristocrats, and later she is at the mercy of Georges Cuvier (Francois Marthouret), a scientist who uses her as part of his vile experiments in hopes of proving Africans are racially inferior.

{"name"=>"Winston Churchill: Walking with Destiny", "rating"=>60, "user_rating"=>40, "mpaa_rating"=>"Unrated", "description"=>"Richard Trank's biographical film focuses on the 20 months between Churchill's ascent to prime minister and the American entry into the Second World War at the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942. But to do that, it must first carry us back to 1930, when Winston Churchill was at the low point of a three-decade political career; still holding a seat in Parliament but out of the government and also out of favor with the leadership of the British Conservative Party, he was in isolation -- political, social, and personal -- for much of the decade that followed. In the intervening years, he wrote and spoke with ever-increasing fervor against the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, a lone voice in a complacent or oblivious world. Eventually, he was brought back into the government begrudgingly by the Conservative Party leadership as First Lord of the Admiralty. And after a decade in isolation, he became the reluctant choice of both King George VI and the outgoing prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, to succeed the latter.Combining his writing ability -- perhaps the most formidable of anyone in government anywhere in the English-speaking world -- and his best moral and political instincts, and one of the best speaking voices in the public life of the era, Churchill became an inspiring figure, both at home and abroad over the ensuing 18 months. Coupled with the near-miraculous success of the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk in the wake of the military disaster in France, his presence became a rallying point for anti-Nazis on both sides of the Atlantic, helping to turn the isolationist tide in American politics amid the turmoil of Franklin Roosevelt's unprecedented run for a third presidential term. All the while, Churchill was also facing daily new threats from an emboldened Germany, now based directly across the English Channel and presumed to be planning an imminent invasion.Trank's movie, bound together with narration by Sir Ben Kingsley, weaves these and many other threads -- including an oddly understated yet suitably relevant one regarding Churchill's connection to Jews in England -- together in a focused account of those 20 treacherous months, and the results are engrossing even to those familiar with most of the material covered. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/18/11151868_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-01-14", "rt_id"=>"771206172", "runtime"=>101, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

The Principality is located on Casley's 75 kilometer wheat farm, and just because no other nation on Earth recognizes it and the population consists only of his family, that doesn't make it any less real to the man who likes to be called His Majesty Prince Leonard I. The Hutt River Principality, along with the Republic of Molossia (covering 1.3 acres in Nevada, its railroad system was purchased at a hobby shop), North Dumpling Island (located off the coast of Connecticut and ruled by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway) and the New Free State of Caroline (a country without a physical territory dreamed up by artist Gregory Green), is explored by filmmaker Jody Shapiro in the documentary (#How To Start Your Own Country}. Shapiro examines the sometimes whimsical, sometimes serious motivations behind the folks who create their own nations, and ponders what difference (if any) there is between The Hutt River Principality and Palestine and Lichtenstein, two other nations not recognized by a number of major governments.

Ka Shen was a gifted dancer and vocalist, and was studying at London's prestigious Royal Ballet School when she was spotted by noted movie producer Ray Stark. Stark was looking for a fresh new talent to star in a film adaptation of Richard Mason's novel The World Of Suzie Wong, and he was had a hunch eighteen-year-old Ka Shen was the sort of woman he was looking for. After several screen tests, Ka Shen won the role of Suzie Wong, and took the stage name Nancy Kwan. The World Of Suzie Wong earned Kwan an Academy Award nomination and made her an overnight star; at a time when most Asian actors were stuck playing demeaning, stereotyped roles (and many roles for Asians were played by Caucasian actors in make-up), Kwan became one of Hollywood's first Asian stars and a big-screen sex symbol. Kwan's next picture was a box-office smash, a screen version of the hit Broadway musical Flower Drum Song, and Kwan worked steadily in major studio productions through the 1960s. In 1972, Kwan moved back to Hong Kong to look after her ailing father and ended up staying ten years, continuing to act while also launching a new career as a producer. Filmmaker Brian Jamieson offers an intimate look as Nancy Kwan's private and professional lives in the documentary To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey, which features extensive interviews with Kwan as well as Sandra Allen, Joan Chen, France Nuyen and Vivian Wu.

Together, they track Bobbi to an isolated ranch where blond, blue-eyed women are forced to bear children who are sold to desperate couples by a man named Frank and his boss, an icy woman with a Southern accent.

Ewen Leslie delivers a great performance as photographer Isaac, whose father's death in suburban Sydney reveals the schism in his family and prompts a return to the ancestral homeland. On a trip to his parent's village in Greece, he learns something of his father's cursed history. At first he dismisses the revelation as superstitious nonsense, but over the course of his travels - from Greece to Paris to Budapest - Isaac is forced to confront the anti-Semitism of the past, the embedded bigotry in the bones of Europe and the nature of inherited guilt. It is on this fateful trip that Isaac will learn the truth of his family's migration to Australia, their refusal to ever return to Greece, and the burden he continues to bear as a consequence of acts committed years before his birth.

Almost ten years later, Jeanette Maier tells her side of the story in the documentary The Canal Street Madam, in which Maier talks about how she got into the sex trade, the sort of clientele her house attracted, her relationship with her family and how the publicity from the arrest and subsequent trial nearly ruined her life. Maier also shares her views on the judicial system and the legal status of prostitution in America, and we're given a glimpse of her efforts to start a new life and career after being transformed into a scandalous public figure. Directed by Cameron Yates, The Canal Street Madam received its world premiere at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival. It wasn't the first film about Maier and her misadventures; the made-for-television feature The Madame's Family: The Truth About The Canal Street Brothel started Annabella Sciorra as Jeanette Maier and Ellen Burstyn and Dominique Swain as her mother and daughter. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/12/70/11127086_det.jpg", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"770872502", "runtime"=>89, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

Curious, she follows the rabbit to an enormous tree, and tumbles down a hole that takes her to Underland, a strange world inhabited by anthropomorphic creatures in search of someone to save them from the dreaded Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has assumed control of the kingdom by decapitating anyone who dares disagree with her. According to a scroll detailing a historical timeline of Underland -- including events that have not yet taken place -- it is Alice who will set the kingdom free by defeating the Jabberwocky, a powerful dragon-like creature under the control of the Red Queen. But is this Alice the same Alice who appears in the scroll? While some of the creatures of Underland have their doubts, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and his friends are certain she's the same girl who previously visited them years ago.

The documentary's focus is French-born L.A. thrift-shop owner Thierry Guetta, whose apparent compulsion to videotape every moment of his life led him to document the phenomenon of contemporary street art. Guetta's cousin, a street artist known as Space Invader, allowed the avid cameraman to tape him as he illegally spread his artwork, and Space Invader also introduced him to other street artists, whose work Guetta captured on tape. Eventually, Guetta hooked up with Shepard Fairey, who was best known (before he created an iconic Barack Obama campaign poster) for his widespread stickers featuring an image of the late wrestler Andre the Giant over the word \"OBEY.\" Guetta soon hears about the mysterious street artist/prankster Banksy, and becomes obsessed with finding him and videotaping his exploits. Thanks to Guettta's growing reputation among street artists, the two eventually meet and form a sort of partnership. Guetta even videotapes Banksy's infamous \"Gitmo\" prank at Disneyland, wherein a handcuffed, hooded figure in an orange jumpsuit is placed beside one of the rides. They get along quite well until Banksy suggests that Guetta stop shooting, take the countless hours of footage he's accumulated, and start assembling them into a documentary. Banksy eventually takes over the documentary project, and inadvertently pushes Guetta's creative energy in a new direction, as Guetta becomes a kind of street artist himself, with shocking results. Exit Through the Gift Shop, narrated by Rhys Ifans, had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. While it was very well received, there was much speculation as to the documentary's veracity and the provenance of Guetta, his videotape, and his artwork. Given Banksy's reputation, that should not come as a surprise. ~ Josh Ralske, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/12/76/11127648_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-04-16", "rt_id"=>"770860526", "runtime"=>86, "genres"=>[]}

The story begins with the AMA's attack on their non-drug providing rivals, the chiropractic profession. Interviews and historical footage expose the AMA's clandestine campaign to eliminate chiropractic services, which culminates in a 15 year legal battle known as the Wilk case. Sheehan uses this story, and the following stories of patients seeking or forced into alternative treatments, as \"a small doorway into a large room.\" The key point made early in the film is that as it relates to health care almost all areas have been \"doctored\". Endemic of the problem is the plight of today's MD who is forced to forgo the \"art\" of medicine in exchange for 12-15 minute appointments and forced prescriptions dispensing. The film also shows spectacular successes from seeming chiropractic miracles from Olympic gold medalists, Hall of Fame NBA players and a mother that was sent home to die who regains health. Sheehan and Hays shot hundreds of hours of footage from Surgeons, MD's, DC's, DO's, patients from Picabo Street and John Stockton; normal, every day people fighting for their lives, shown in crisis, each having to choose to follow the normal, drug-based, standard of care or risk everything by providing or accepting belittled alternative therapies.

Wally Mars (Bateman) is a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist. Hopelessly neurotic and unrepentantly narcissistic, he gets no joy out of life except for the time he spends with his best friend Kassie (Jennifer Aniston). However, despite the fact that Wally pines to be more than just friends with Kassie, she isn't convinced they'd make a good couple. When Kassie announces to Wally that she's found the perfect sperm donor, he's crestfallen; as far as he's concerned, the ideal candidate is standing right in front of her. Later, Kassie selects handsome stranger Roland (Patrick Wilson) to provide the seed. Things get complicated when Kassie's best friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis) throws an \"insemination party\" to commemorate the big event, and Wally intercepts Roland's special delivery, drunkenly replacing it with his own before blacking out. Pregnant and content, Kassie leaves the city for Minnesota, where she gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Flash-forward seven years, and Kassie returns to New York with her son, Sebastian (Thomas Robinson), who shares an uncanny number of physical and psychological traits with embittered bachelor Wally. Before long Wally and Sebastian have become good friends, and Wally becomes convinced that the boy is his biological son. His ideal family is finally within reach, and if he can just figure out a means of breaking the news to Kassie gently, perhaps she'll find it in her heart to forgive him, and recognize that he'll make the perfect father for Sebastian. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/10/95/44/10954487_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-08-20", "rt_id"=>"770810632", "runtime"=>101, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Comedy"}, {:name=>"Romance"}]}

{"name"=>"Spy", "rating"=>13, "user_rating"=>46, "mpaa_rating"=>"PG", "description"=>"Reminiscent of Kindergarten Cop, with a dash of Spy Kids, The Spy Next Door blends together an entertaining mixture of family fun and martial-arts comedy styling to form a familiar story that once again reminds us that even hardened action heroes have a soft side. Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho, an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. There's nothing in Spy that the audience hasn't seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier), but, fans will appreciate director Brian Levant's homage to Jackie Chan's past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably, Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence, which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films.The main story centers on Bob's relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll), nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley), and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver, Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she's gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that's clearly over his head, Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch, GPS tracking, x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid's affection, but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family, Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly, there's a certain level of cheese in this film, especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains, Poldark (Magnus Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher), whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention, the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian, who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys, which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent, Glaze, and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob's BFF Colton James, who lends folksy witticisms like \"As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.\"Even so, Chan's charm wins out in the end, and The Spy Next Door's most effective sequences involve Bob's attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative, and the audience can't help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films, but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina O'Connor, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/77/10927764_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-01-15", "rt_id"=>"770807290", "runtime"=>92, "genres"=>[]}

Curious, she follows the rabbit to an enormous tree, and tumbles down a hole that takes her to Underland, a strange world inhabited by anthropomorphic creatures in search of someone to save them from the dreaded Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has assumed control of the kingdom by decapitating anyone who dares disagree with her. According to a scroll detailing a historical timeline of Underland -- including events that have not yet taken place -- it is Alice who will set the kingdom free by defeating the Jabberwocky, a powerful dragon-like creature under the control of the Red Queen. But is this Alice the same Alice who appears in the scroll? While some of the creatures of Underland have their doubts, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and his friends are certain she's the same girl who previously visited them years ago.

But the crucial catch was not to be. Instead, a flurry of hands reached out from the stands, deflecting the ball into the crowd, and instantly one man's name, like Bill Buckner's before it, became synonymous with blowing it in a critical, high-stakes moment: Steve Bartman. In fact, dozens of errors contributed to the Cubs' loss in 2003, and the Red Sox still had one more whole game to play in the 1986 World Series after Buckner's legendary gaffe-yet these are moments that will live forever in the annals of sports infamy.

With Catching Hell, Academy Award (R)-winning documentarian and Tribeca alum Alex Gibney probes this topic of sports curses and scapegoats with his signature incisiveness, tracing the roots of our compulsion to focus misplaced blame for an entire team's legacy on small moments of tangible ineptitude.

As a result, the morose monster takes a trip into an alternate-universe Far Far Away land where there is no Shrek, and Rumpelstiltskin reigns. There, Donkey spends his days hauling carts, and a portly Puss in Boots prefers lounging to swashbuckling. Perhaps with a little extra effort, Shrek will be able to regain his status as top ogre in town and still have his happily ever after, too. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/12/76/11127605_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-05-21", "rt_id"=>"770810590", "runtime"=>93, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Thriller"}, {:name=>"Romance"}]}

No army in the world can match the speed, brutality or seeming prescience of the weaponized Mimic fighters or their telepathic commanders. But now the world's armies have joined forces for a last stand offensive against the alien horde, with no second chances. Lt. Col. Bill Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously demoted and then dropped - untrained and ill-equipped - into what amounts to little more than a suicide mission. Cage is killed within minutes, managing to take an Alpha down with him. But, impossibly, he awakens back at the beginning of the same hellish day, and is forced to fight and die again...and again. Direct physical contact with the alien has thrown him into a time loop - dooming him to live out the same brutal combat over and over. But with each pass, Cage becomes tougher, smarter, and able to engage the Mimics with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski, who has lain waste to more Mimics than anyone on Earth. As Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated battle becomes an opportunity to find the key to annihilating the alien invaders and saving the Earth.", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>"2014-03-07", "rt_id"=>"771317257", "runtime"=>"", "genres"=>[]}
