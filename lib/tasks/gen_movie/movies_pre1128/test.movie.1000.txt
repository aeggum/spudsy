However, soon his cult status began to override the art that had made him famous in the first place. Director Tamra Davis pays homage to her friend in this definitive documentary but also delves into Basquiat as an iconoclast. His dense, bebop-influenced neoexpressionist work emerged while minimalist, conceptual art was the fad; as a successful black artist, he was constantly confronted by racism and misconceptions. Much can be gleaned from insider interviews and archival footage, but it is Basquiat's own words and work that powerfully convey the mystique and allure of both the artist and the man. --&copy; Arthouse Films", "poster"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/14/86/11148633_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-07-21", "rt_id"=>"771201798", "runtime"=>88, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Drama"}, {:name=>"History"}, {:name=>"Indie"}]}
