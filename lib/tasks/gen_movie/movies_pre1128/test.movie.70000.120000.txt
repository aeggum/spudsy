Nelu (Andras Hathazi) is a middle-aged guy who works in a supermarket in a Romanian town not far from the border with Hungary. Nelu doesn't ask much of life besides a few beers with his friends and an occasional fishing trip on his days off, and he's treating himself to the latter at a spot just over the Hungarian line when he sees a man who looks to be lost and hiding. While the stranger speaks only Turkish and Nelu only speaks Romanian, in time he figures out that the man's name is Behran (Yilmaz Yalcin) and that he's slipped into Hungary illegally while trying to make his way to Germany to visit his son. Sympathetic to Behran's troubles, he smuggles him into Romania and lets him stay in his basement, telling his suspicious wife that Behran is a gypsy handyman doing some repairs. However, while Nelu wants to help his new friend get at least a border or two closer to his family, making that happen turns out to be more complicated than either man expects, with the language barrier not helping a bit. Morgen is named for the one word in German both men know, meaning \"tomorrow;\" the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Locarno Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/15/82/11158267_det.jpg", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771228944", "runtime"=>100, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Drama"}, {:name=>"Foreign"}]}

The three men were found murdered after a careful search, but despite overwhelming evidence, three of the Klansmen who committed the crime went free when their jury could not deliver a verdict.

The documentary's focus is French-born L.A. thrift-shop owner Thierry Guetta, whose apparent compulsion to videotape every moment of his life led him to document the phenomenon of contemporary street art. Guetta's cousin, a street artist known as Space Invader, allowed the avid cameraman to tape him as he illegally spread his artwork, and Space Invader also introduced him to other street artists, whose work Guetta captured on tape. Eventually, Guetta hooked up with Shepard Fairey, who was best known (before he created an iconic Barack Obama campaign poster) for his widespread stickers featuring an image of the late wrestler Andre the Giant over the word \"OBEY.\" Guetta soon hears about the mysterious street artist/prankster Banksy, and becomes obsessed with finding him and videotaping his exploits. Thanks to Guettta's growing reputation among street artists, the two eventually meet and form a sort of partnership. Guetta even videotapes Banksy's infamous \"Gitmo\" prank at Disneyland, wherein a handcuffed, hooded figure in an orange jumpsuit is placed beside one of the rides. They get along quite well until Banksy suggests that Guetta stop shooting, take the countless hours of footage he's accumulated, and start assembling them into a documentary. Banksy eventually takes over the documentary project, and inadvertently pushes Guetta's creative energy in a new direction, as Guetta becomes a kind of street artist himself, with shocking results. Exit Through the Gift Shop, narrated by Rhys Ifans, had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. While it was very well received, there was much speculation as to the documentary's veracity and the provenance of Guetta, his videotape, and his artwork.

The journey begins at the annual Vent Haven convention in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, ventriloquism capitol of the world (now you know where to take your next vacation). The film focuses on five 'vents', who are quirky enough to star in Christopher Guest's BEST IN SHOW. But they are real, and their stories are deeply human and universal: Dylan, a shy 13-year-old who dreams of being a professional but whose dad prefers football; Kim, a former Miss Ohio beauty queen, who yearns to 'make it' on the cruise ship circuit; Dan, a successful cruise ship performer whose wife may divorce him when he comes ashore; Terry, who, after 22 years of struggle in Corsicana, Texas, finds himself on NBC's America's Got Talent with a chance to win $1 million; and Wilma -- all six-foot-five of her -- who brings her dummies to Walmart and 'entertains' in senior homes. With its heart firmly planted on its polyester sleeve, Dumbstruck takes the American dream sideways and never loses its way. The film traverses the country from coast to coast, cruising the Mexican Riviera, Bahamas and Japan. We share in their successes and missteps, both on- and off-stage, as they strive in their own ways to achieve the American dream.

When Diane Schuler, her son and daughter, and three nieces departed from an upstate New York campground on July 26, 2009, by all accounts their drive home to Long Island should have been an uneventful one. Within just four hours, however, Diane and most of her young passengers, as well as the three passengers in a separate SUV, were all dead. For reasons unknown, Diane had driven the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway for four miles, crashing directly into an SUV and causing an accident that would send a shockwave of grief across the nation. The sole survivor of the accident was Diane's young son Bryan. When the toxicology reports were completed, the authorities announced that at the time of the collision Diane's blood alcohol level was .19%, and that there was also a significant amount of THC in her system. But were alcohol and marijuana really to blame for this awful misfortune? By all accounts, Diane was a devoted mother who aimed for nothing short of perfection in both her career and her family life. Upon closer inspection, however, it was soon revealed that Diane had a troubled family history as a young girl - one that she still struggled with well into adulthood. In this documentary, filmmakers trace the efforts made my Diane's family to seek an alternate cause for the crash that could clear her name, and talk with the family of Guy and Michael Bastardi, who were killed in the crash along with their friend and passenger Daniel Longo, about the way this catastrophe has affected their lives. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771249319", "runtime"=>99, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

It isn't long before the crime scene videographers (an out-of-work film director (Todd Berger) and producer (Jeff Grace)) realize that Charlie might be the real story and decide to make a movie about him. Eventually the killer wants his day in the spotlight and begins to make a movie of his own. Charlie must race against time to save the life of the final victim. Unless, of course, Charlie was the killer all along.... The film's soundtrack (and plot) features indie-rock favorites The Airborne Toxic Event, The Cribs, The Sonics, Wallpaper, Le Switch, and many more. -- (C) Official", "poster"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/10/92/08/10920814_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-02-11", "rt_id"=>"770790125", "runtime"=>96, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Comedy"}, {:name=>"Crime"}, {:name=>"Mystery"}, {:name=>"Thriller"}]}

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

With school on Easter break, Anna's mother Jeanne (Lio) takes her to visit her grandfather Jean (Michel Galabru), whose health is failing and may not have long to live. Anne is startled when she learns that Jeanne and her father Paul (Thierry Neuvic) have split up, particularly given Jeanne's devotion to the Catholic Church. As Jeanne struggles with the collapse of her marriage, she seeks comfort in the counsel of Father Francois (Stefano Cassetti), but Anna suspects he may be offering more than spiritual advice. Meanwhile, Anna strikes up a friendship with Pierre (Youen Leboulanger-Gourvil), a boy her age who lives nearby, and she's torn between her blossoming desires and the strict teachings of the church. Named for a song by Serge Gainsbourg, Un Poison Violent (aka Love Like Poison) was an official selection at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/73/11157324_det.jpg", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771040714", "runtime"=>92, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Drama"}, {:name=>"Foreign"}]}

Bhati runs a small cafe next to a luxury hotel that's home to King Rudra and his young son Prince Ranvijay. Chotu is bothered that his name is so common among street kids in India; determined not to let poverty hold him back, Chotu impulsively changes his name to Kalam, after a former Indian president, and when he happens to meet Ranvijay, the two strike up a friendship. Kalam envies Ranvijay's wealth and privilege, while Ranvijay wishes he had Kalam's freedom. Kalam encourages Ranvijay to attend school with him, and the wealthy youngster finds he enjoys getting to know other kids his age, though keeping his new pastime a secret from his father is no small accomplishment.

Phineas Flynn is the American chatterbox; Ferb Fletcher is British and taciturn. The television movie Across the 2nd Dimension takes their antics further afield--and spoofs the mania for 3-D. When their giant shuttlecock collides with a spy plane piloted by their pet Perry the Platypus, Phineas and Ferb crash land in the laboratory of Dr. Doofenshmirtz. With typical enthusiasm (and blithe unawareness), the boys help the evil scientist build an \"Otherdimensionator\" that transports them to an alternate world. As the complications multiply, Perry is forced to reveal that he's not just a pet who grinds his teeth: he's Agent P, part of a cadre dedicated to fighting Doofenshmirtz's schemes. Eventually things get sorted out with the help of the alternate versions of Phineas, Ferb, and their sister Candace. Across the 2nd Dimension is most engaging when it plays like an extended episode of the series, with plenty of humor, off-beat songs, and pop-culture references: Doofenshmirtz and his alternate counterpart perform a number about finally finding a partner as the Blues Brothers, the Lone Ranger and Tonto, and Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory. As is often the case with TV cartoons that morph into features (Hey Arnold, Doug), things occasionally get too big--the swarms of CG robots the alternate Doofenshmirtz dispatches really don't add anything to the story. But the filmmakers generally succeed in walking a fine line, remaining smart without becoming smart alecks.

In 2002 brothers Nathan, Caleb, and Jared Followill, along with their cousin Matthew, formed the grungy alternative rock band in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee.

Most of the brothers' young lives were spent in poverty, living in the back of an Oldsmobile while touring around the Bible Belt from church to church with the brothers' father, Ivan Leon, a Pentecostal preacher, and their mother BettyAnn, who tried desperately to ground the family during their travels. Rebelling from the God-fearing gypsy lifestyle in true rocker fashion, the young men turned to secular music and a few recreational drugs in Nashville... and the rest is history etched in platinum and gold.

Champion bodybuilder Devin Dearth was 40 years old, and in perfect health when a massive stroke caused by bleeding on the brain stem struck him virtually out of the blue. With half of his body paralyzed, his speech abilities severely limited, and his vision badly distorted, the once-virile father and successful business man could no longer provide for his family. His odds of recovery were slim, yet despite the fact that Devon was making steady improvements thanks to in-patient therapy, his forward trajectory would soon start to slip back as complications with insurance forced him to move back home. Upon learning that doctors in Tianjian, China were making remarkable progress in treating stroke victims by combining Western medical techniques with traditional Chinese methods, Devon's brother Doug rallied the community together and raised the money pay for treatment abroad. Once there, the progress Devon began to make after being immediately plunged into the intense treatment program was nothing short of astonishing.

She wakes up in the hospital only to find her bright future destroyed and the baby she is still carrying, dead. Her husband, Michel (Patrick Labbe) is too unnerved and emotionally bereft to deal with the tragedy. As her life unravels, she stumbles across Henry - who has been searching for his victim. Unaware of what he has done, Nathalie sees him as an unlikely guardian angel, everything Michel is not - compassionate, charming and a little crazy. She finds a welcome relief in the tall, rumpled stranger that seems only too willing to offer her refuge. But Henry has his own problems. His past misdeeds are catching up, and he soon discovers that the police are steadily closing in. The inevitable collision will force both Henry and Nathalie to confront loss, labour and life, and to ultimately decide whether the cost of living is worth the price. -- (C) Official Site", "poster"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/71/11157158_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-05-13", "rt_id"=>"771208738", "runtime"=>92, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Drama"}]}

Before too long, he graduates to weapons training, shootouts and kidnappings. A good, kind man trying to earn for his family, Narasimha finds himself in a position he had never bargained for; a man left with no choices. The conflicted Narasimha's life gets more complicated when a confrontation with the group leader turns his world upside down; now he's caught in the middle of the law and the militants.

Or, does he look out for himself and his family, and embrace the Naxal cause?

Drug and alcohol abuse is rampant there, with Cass an apt and tragic example -- his doctor has said he has two years to live if he can't quit drinking, but he still spends his days with fellow alcoholics drinking beer in the park. One resident calls Hebden Bridge \"a drug town with a tourist problem,\" and though those with the strength and the means move away (like Lewis), those left sink even deeper into depression, and some who can no longer numb their pain and emptiness turn to suicide.

By spending his days as a substitute teacher, he conveniently avoids any emotional connections by never staying anywhere long enough to form an attachment to either students or colleagues. When a new assignment places him at a public school where a frustrated, burned-out administration has created an apathetic student body, Henry soon becomes a role model to the disaffected youth. In finding an unlikely emotional connection to the students, teachers, and a runaway teen he takes in from the streets, Henry realizes that he's not alone in his life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world. -- (C) Tribeca Film", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/30/11163060_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2012-03-16", "rt_id"=>"771239141", "runtime"=>100, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Drama"}]}

{"name"=>"Truth in Numbers? Everything, According to Wikipedia", "rating"=>-1, "user_rating"=>80, "mpaa_rating"=>"PG", "description"=>"\"Truth in Numbers? Everything, According to Wikipedia,\" a film by Scott Glosserman and Nic Hill showing the inner workings of the online information resource, will make its debut in a number of countries as part of worldwide celebrations of Wikipedia's 10th anniversary on January 15, 2011. Anniversary celebrations in Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK will include screenings of the film for wikipedians and other fans of the website. The film illustrates a debate between traditional media and the proponents of crowd-sourced information over the reliability of the information found on Wikipedia, and the impact of having such a widely-used resource written and edited by non-experts. Using interviews with Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, Noam Chomsky, the late Howard Zinn, Jaron Lanier, Lawrence Lessig, Ray Kurzweil, and many others, \"Truth in Numbers?\" reveals surprisingly intense and emotional opinions on both sides, while also giving viewers an inside look at how Wikipedia works, who exactly is editing on the site, and the enormous international cultural phenomenon that it has become in the 10 years since its founding. After viewing this film, you will never look at Wikipedia the same way. The filmmakers engagingly explore the history and cultural implications of one of the most referenced sites on the Web. A whole range of opinion is expressed about the impact of Wikipedia on the archiving of learning, from interviews with founder Jimmy Wales to commentators suspicious of the site's supposed neutrality. Evenhandedly weaving multiple perspectives about the impact of Wikipedia, the film provokes a deeper conversation on how knowledge is formed and what future generations will learn about history and the world.-- (c) official site", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/57/11155760_det.jpg", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771229418", "runtime"=>85, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

Even if you doubt the severity of the impact of climate change or just don't buy it at all, this is a compelling and relevant film that illustrates how SOLUTIONS to climate change also address other social, economic and national security issues. 'Carbon Nation' is an optimistic discovery of what people are already doing, what we as a nation could be doing and what the world needs to do to prevent (or slow down) the impending climate crisis. We already have the technology to combat most of the worst-case scenarios of climate change, and it is very good business as well. We meet a host of entertaining and endearing characters along the way, including entrepreneurs, visionaries, scientists, business, and the everyday man, all making a difference and working towards solving climate change. We interviewed over 200 people - included in the film are Richard Branson (CEO, Virgin Group), Thomas L. Friedman (New York Times), Former CIA Director James Woolsey, Van Jones (Founder, Green For All), Col. Dan Nolan, U.S. Army (Ret), Bernie Karl (Geothermal pioneer from Alaska,) Amory Lovins (Chairman, RMI), Art Rosenfeld (Commissioner, California Energy Commission), Denis Hayes (Founder of Earth Day), Ralph Cavanagh (NRDC), Lester Brown (Earth Policy Institute), John Rowe (CEO, Exelon), Jim Rogers (CEO Duke Energy), Cliff Etheredge (West Texas wind pioneer,)and more climate change pioneers. Public opinion is sliding the wrong way - far fewer people are concerned about climate change than even a year ago. We've made Carbon Nation to give a majority of people an entertaining, informed and pragmatic primer about why it's incredibly smart to be a part of the new, low-carbon economy: its good business. Carbon Nation's optimism and pragmatism are appealing across the political spectrum.

Instead, a flurry of hands reached out from the stands, deflecting the ball into the crowd, and instantly one man's name, like Bill Buckner's before it, became synonymous with blowing it in a critical, high-stakes moment: Steve Bartman. In fact, dozens of errors contributed to the Cubs' loss in 2003, and the Red Sox still had one more whole game to play in the 1986 World Series after Buckner's legendary gaffe-yet these are moments that will live forever in the annals of sports infamy.

Never before has a high Tibetan Master allowed such complete access to his private life and it is doubtful that another ever will. -- (C) Long Shot Factory", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/07/11160704_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-10-28", "rt_id"=>"771254130", "runtime"=>100, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}, {:name=>"Foreign"}]}

Though the movie was a critical and commercial hit, it also stirred up torrents of indignation, particularly from Christian groups who found it transparently offensive. The Pythons disagreed, and even argued that the film contained a highly religious message buried in its comedy. Things came to a boil when Cleese and Palin participated in a talk show aired by a Catholic broadcaster and featuring a Bishop from the Church of England. This 2011 docudrama travels back to the late 1970s to recreate many of the events surrounding the film's controversy, including that famous talk show appearance.

Throughout their trip, both characters experience long periods of carefree bliss and unrepentant joy punctuated by brief moments of guilt and confusion.

Snippets of information begin to reveal who these two are, but it's not enough to judge them. It's the viewer's participation that creates the intrigue as the screenplay delicately weaves vital information about the LOVERS into the narrative thread. Shot in two weeks on a whirlwind tour through the most romantic Old World cities of Europe-FOR LOVERS ONLY is inspired by Claude Lelouche's A MAN AND A WOMAN encapsulates the spirit of the French New Wave.

The 1988 concert film Rattle and Hum and its accompanying soundtrack album didn't please fans or critics, and the group's attempts to fuse American roots music with their trademark style clearly wasn't working. The four members of the group -- vocalist Bono, guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. -- were at odds with one another and uncertain about their musical future. The group responded to their dilemma by throwing out their self-imposed rule book and making the album Achtung, Baby, in which the group faced down their uncertainties and responded with the most stylistically ambitious music they'd ever created. Filmmaker Davis Guggenheim offers a rare glimpse into U2's creative process with the documentary From The Sky On Down, in which the band discusses the making of Achtung, Baby and opens up about the issues within the band and in the outside world that inspired its creation. The film also includes rare audio and video of U2 in rehearsal and in the studio while the album was in production.

In 1929, researchers first discovered the Yanomamo Indians, an indigenous tribe living in Brazil along the Amazon. The Yanomami were believed to be perhaps the last band of primitive peoples essentially untouched by civilization, and they became a favorite subject of study among anthropologists, especially in the 1960s. However, different studies of the Yanomami produced wildly different conclusions -- one book on the tribe described them as a warlike people who often fought amongst themselves, while another celebrated their society in which violence was little known. While different research teams may have had different perceptions of the Yanomamo tribe, nearly all of them made the mistake of interfering in the lives of their subjects, with disastrous results. Kenneth Good didn't just study the tribe, he married a 13-year-old Yanomamo girl, while Jacques Lizot frequently paid teenage Yanomamo boys for sex. Western anthropologists also unwittingly exposed the Yanomami to diseases for which they had no immunity, leading to widespread illness and death among the natives. In time, the Yanomami began actively driving anthropologists away, angry over the way in which their culture had been spoiled for the benefit of others. Secrets Of The Tribe was an official selection at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>"2009-12-31", "rt_id"=>"770859328", "runtime"=>110, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}, {:name=>"Foreign"}]}

Rwandan filmmaker Alrick Brown examines this dark page in his country's history in this drama. Kinyarwanda traces a handful of interconnected stories of both hatred and compassion amidst the bloodshed of 1994. As Hutus launch their massacre of the Tutsis, a powerful Muslim leader (Jean Mutsari) opens his mosque to those on either side who seek peaceful refuge. The Mufti is joined by a Catholic priest (Kennedy Mpazimpaka) who is being hunted down due to his Tutsi background. Two Rwandan soldiers (Cassandra Freeman and Kena Anae Onyenjekwe) bond as they try to keep order and help refugees as they discuss their feelings on the massacre. A young boy unwittingly invites the violence into his family's home as a young couple (Zaninka Hadidja and Marc Gwamaka) finds their mixed ethnic heritage puts them both at risk. And one Hutu insurgent (Edouard Bamporiki) is in time forced to answer for his violent actions.
