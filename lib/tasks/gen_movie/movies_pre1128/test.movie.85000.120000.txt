But despite the limitations of his body, Petrucciani developed a great passion for music, and he began studying the piano as a child under the direction of his father, a jazz aficionado and writer. By the time he was 13, Petrucciani was an accomplished pianist; by 18, he was a celebrity in European jazz circles with a few albums under his belt when he traveled to the United States with the help of a friend. Petrucciani was befriended by the great jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, who came out of retirement to perform with the diminutive Frenchman, and before long Petrucciani became the first European artist to sign with the prestigious jazz label Blue Note Records. Despite his short stature and fragile body, Petrucciani became a star and a legend on the jazz circuit, albeit one with appetites that would challenge a much stronger man. Filmmaker Michael Radford examines the remarkable true story of an artist who defied the odds during his short but eventful life in the documentary Michel Petrucciani, which includes extensive performance footage of the pianist as well as interviews with his friends, family, and colleagues.

The film explores ideas of abundance, emptiness, human connection and abandonment while observing an interweaving web of awkward characters who maintain hope by inventing their own forms of communication and self-fulfillment. Katrina (Carrie Brownstein) is a twenty-something reality TV enthusiast, video diarist and animal shelter worker whose world falls apart when she finds that those important to her are often not what she hopes they would be. Eli (James Mercer) is a mid-30s slacker who could offer a thoroughly researched social critique explaining all the reasons why he shouldn't get a job; his experiences temping only reinforce his assertions. Camille (Renee Roman Nose) is a socially handicapped thrift store attendant who spends her days sorting through the donated discards of other people's lives, and Otis (David Wodehouse) is an 84-year-old eccentric filmmaker and inventor who strives to be recognized for his work. Some Days are Better Than Others is about the nuances of communication, the desperation of heartbreak, and the struggle to maintain hope through the passing of time. It's a sad valentine to the forgotten discards of a throwaway society, and a story about knowing when to hold on, and when to let go. -- (C) Official Site", "poster"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/70/11157073_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-06-03", "rt_id"=>"771209990", "runtime"=>93, "genres"=>[]}

A tireless collector of paintings that the Soviet government wanted destroyed, Savitsky traveled thousands of miles - scheming, plotting, pleading - doing whatever it took to get his hands on the art he so passionately wanted to preserve. As a result of his efforts, The Karakalpakstan State Museum of Art named after Savitsky, also known as the Nukus Museum - hosts the world's second largest collection of Russian Avant Garde Art (after the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg). Winner of the Cine Golden Eagle Award; Best Documentary Award at Palm Beach International Film Festival, and the Audience Award at Beijing International Film Festival, THE DESERT OF FORBIDDEN ART, a documentary written, produced and directed by Amanda Pope and Tchavdar Georgiev, will have its US Theatrical premiere at Cinema Village in New York on March 11, followed by a Los Angeles release at Laemmle Theaters on March 18. A 52-minute version of the film will premiere on the Emmy Award-winning PBS series Independent Lens, hosted by America Ferrera, on Tuesday, April 5, 2011 at 10 PM. A frustrated artist, Savitsky was working as an archaeologist when he became fascinated by the indigenous cultures of Western Uzbekistan. He began to collect jewelry, coins, handmade clothing and other items in danger of being lost as the Soviets sought to devalue distinctively ethnic artifacts. Savitsky even succeeded in convincing government officials to provide funding for a museum in Nukus, far from Moscow's prying eyes. But then Savitsky discovered his true calling. Pretending to buy State-approved art, he daringly rescued over 40,000 works by artists banned during the Stalin era for speaking out against authority, for being gay, or for simply refusing to paint in the style they were told. Risking torture, imprisonment and death, this small group had remained true to their artistic vision. Savitsky even managed to cajole the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who had banned it. Savitsky's greatest discovery was an unknown school of artists who settled in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917. There they encountered an Islamic culture as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin, developing a startlingly original style that fused European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions. To Savitsky the paintings were a revelation. Around the saga of Savitsky and the artists, the filmmakers weave the cultural and political context of the times, juxtaposing beautiful and colorful images from the collection with rare Soviet archival film and stills. Ben Kingsley, Sally Field and Ed Asner voice the diaries and letters of Savitsky and the artists, bringing to life a dramatic journey of sacrifice for the sake of creative freedom. Today the priceless paintings that Savitsky spent his life collecting are located in one of the world's poorest regions, making them a lucrative target for Islamic fundamentalists, corrupt bureaucrats and art profiteers. The collection remains as endangered as when Savitsky first created it, posing the question of whose responsibility it is to preserve this cultural treasure. In November 2010, the original two story building of the Savitsky State Museum was vacated by the Uzbek government without providing any new space for the storage and exhibition of the works. The building will be demolished shortly, and reportedly the government will construct a bank and the local Ministry of Justice in its place. -- (C) Olive Films", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/54/11155488_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-03-11", "rt_id"=>"770866232", "runtime"=>80, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}, {:name=>"History"}, {:name=>"Foreign"}]}

The goal of his survey is to assess possible routes for a water canal from the region's only voluminous river. For many of the region's inhabitants, the canal will be a lifeline, the chance for a future and a source of hope. But for those living on the canal's direct course, it means only requisitions, departure, and loss. Many of the properties through which Renato passes will be flooded; many of the people and families will be relocated. As the fieldtrip progresses, it becomes clear that Renato shares something in common with the places he visits: emptiness, a sense of abandonment, and isolation. His geological research is slowly pervaded by a sensation of groundlessness, an incessant pining for his ex-wife, and a yearning to return home. But he presses ahead, continuing the trip in the hope that the voyage can somehow transmute his feelings. This haunting, melancholy, and resourceful film takes the form of a first-person travelogue, communicating its unseen protagonist's sensibility and state of mind through an impressionistic photographic record of the landscapes through which he travels and the people he encounters, and his own nakedly revealing, confessional narration.

Curious, she follows the rabbit to an enormous tree, and tumbles down a hole that takes her to Underland, a strange world inhabited by anthropomorphic creatures in search of someone to save them from the dreaded Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has assumed control of the kingdom by decapitating anyone who dares disagree with her. According to a scroll detailing a historical timeline of Underland -- including events that have not yet taken place -- it is Alice who will set the kingdom free by defeating the Jabberwocky, a powerful dragon-like creature under the control of the Red Queen. But is this Alice the same Alice who appears in the scroll? While some of the creatures of Underland have their doubts, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and his friends are certain she's the same girl who previously visited them years ago. When the Red Queen kidnaps the Mad Hatter, Alice attempts to free her friend and locate the one weapon with the power to slay the Jabberwocky, thereby restoring the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to the throne, and bringing peace back to Underland. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/93/73/10937308_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-03-05", "rt_id"=>"770683926", "runtime"=>109, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Fantasy"}]}

But the rise of 1980s rock and new wave saw a decline in Simon's commercial success, and the singer responded by experimenting with different musical styles--most notably, world beat--that culminated in his adventurous 1986 masterpiece GRACELAND. The album's fusion of American folk-rock songwriting and buoyant South African rhythms not only broke new ground in pop music, but became Simon's biggest-selling solo record. This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series examines the making of Simon's groundbreaking work through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos, and live performances of album tracks such as \"Boy in the Bubble,\" \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"You Can Call Me Al,\" and \"Under African Skies.\"", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"770831599", "runtime"=>"", "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

Three years in the making, this documentary is a strange rite of passage for all involved. Themes receiving daily scrutiny and detailing include cars and license plates, capitalism, anger, justice, drunkenness, spiritual awareness, class struggle, entitlement, and working in the Service Sector. These all mesh together in the orbit of the Parking Lot Attendant. For these Parking Attendants, the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom becomes the challenge. Something as simple as a parking lot becomes an emotional way station for The American Dream.

As the founder of Grameen Bank, Yunus pioneered microcredit, the innovative banking program that provides poor people - mainly women - with small loans they use to launch businesses and lift their families out of poverty. His Grameen Bank currently lends to one out of every 1,000 people on earth and with a 98% rate of return - unheard of in the financial world. But Muhammad Yunus didn't stop there. Bonsai People offers a glimpse into his visionary work. -- (C) Official Site", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/35/11163584_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2012-02-10", "rt_id"=>"771256697", "runtime"=>90, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}, {:name=>"Drama"}]}

It is also an auspicious second feature from director Jie Han, whose distinctive voice is already more than clear. The vast and snowy landscapes of northern China form the striking backdrop to the story of Shu - whose name translates to \"tree\" in Mandarin - a clownish mechanic who resides in a small mining village in the province of Jilin. Shu has a reputation as a slacker, a drunk and a danger to himself and others. He blinds himself temporarily while welding. He meets a fetching mute named Xiaomei who works at a massage parlour and decides to marry her, but this too falls apart. Meanwhile, Shu's village seems as doomed as he is. The film opens on a van saddled with loudspeakers, which roams the village offering consumer goods as bribes to townsfolk in the hope that they'll willingly uproot themselves to make way for modern property developments. As with so many rural places in China, a way of life is vanishing under the wheels of progress. Teased by hallucinations and haunted by tragic events from his past (which we learn of through flashbacks and voice-over), Shu struggles with an ever-loosening grip on reality. Yet when one of his visions manifests as real, his fellow villagers come to regard him as clairvoyant. Can Shu genuinely see into the future? Is he actually just a basket case? Or is he perhaps more lucid than he seems, and pulling a fast one on everyone?", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771253993", "runtime"=>88, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Comedy"}]}

{"name"=>"Behind the Burly Q", "rating"=>78, "user_rating"=>65, "mpaa_rating"=>"Unrated", "description"=>"Although its origins derive from France, Great Britain and Greece, burlesque became a wildly popularAmerican form of art that thrived in the early to mid part of the 20th century. Because of the sexualinnuendo and the barely-there costumes it has largely been left out of the history books.In the 1840s burlesque was applied to a wide range of comedic plays that entertained the lower and middleclasses in Great Britain. Coming to America, burlesque evolved into shows performed by scantily-cladbeauties. It thrived, appealing to the masses of working class people who weekly stormed the theatres tosee troupes like \"The British Blondes\", a bevy of beauties dressed in tights. Burlesque poked fun at theupper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of obtaining sex. By the 1920sthe old burlesque circuits closed and strip tease was introduced to offer something vaudeville and film didnot.During the Great Depression, for a dime a man could fall into a big gaudy burlesque show and forget histroubles. From theatres to nightclubs, burlesque was a raucous sexy show filled with gorgeous women,strippers, comedians, acrobats and singers. The tame by today's standards, the shows were consideredrisque, and most performers were looked down on as second rate.Backed by public outrage, in 1937 New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed the burlesque houses in hisstate. The use of the word \"burlesque\" was outlawed in advertising. The Minsky brothers, who some sayintroduced nudity to the burly audiences, were so closely associated with burlesque that La Guardia bannedthe use of the name Minsky. Once again, burlesque changed, moving across the river to New Jersey toescape censure. Eventually comedians and musicians' parts were reduced in the shows and more stripperswere brought on. By the 1960s hard-core porn was available and burlesque had died. But what happened tothe thousands of performers? Where did they go?\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the behind-the-scenes stories of these men and women as told by the performersthemselves. For the first time ever, the performers from the golden age of burlesque relate theirheartbreaking, triumphant stories of life on the road performing in the burly circuit. Many were ashamed oftheir past and had never talked about their experiences. Just as many had never been asked.Director Leslie Zemeckis and producer Sheri Hellard traveled extensively across the country from theBayous of post-Katrina Mississippi, to New Jersey, Florida and all points between. The duo tracked downand recorded dozens of interviews with little-known performers to the last of the living legends ofburlesque. They spoke with relatives of many deceased stars. The men and women in this documentaryopened their scrapbooks as well as their hearts, relating memories they had all but forgotten.Amongst those interviewed were former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, funny men andwomen, authors and historians assembled together for the first time ever to tell you just what reallyhappened in a burlesque show. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this theirlast, and often times only interview. We dedicate this film to their memory.\"Behind the Burly Q\" is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday. Funny, shocking,unbelievable and heartbreaking, their stories will touch your hearts. Hear the performers in their ownwords. See the performers in action.

However, a gang of thugs have been trying to steal his instrument, and with attendance down at the tourist hotel where Alfonso plays in the band, he finds himself without a steady gig. Trying to sort out his next move, Alfonso is befriended by his godson Chiquilin (Victor Hugo Monterroso), a teenager with a taste for snipping glue and listening to heavy metal. Through Chiquilin, Alfonso is introduced to Blako (Roberto Gonzalez), a singer much revered in the Guatemalan underground rock scene. Blako, like Alfonso, is in need of a gig, and he hatches an idea -- what about a band that combines the shredding guitars and bellowing vocals of metal with the traditional sound of the marimba?

What most of them don't know is Charlie's life is a house of cards; his business is falling apart, his investments are going bust, his marriage is on its last legs, he's been having an affair with a friend's wife, and he's using credit cards to fend off his inevitable financial collapse. En route to the conference, Charlie runs over a working-class woman with his car; he decides to let the draw of a card determine if he calls the police or simply moves on, and over the rest of the weekend, he uses a deck of cards to make his choices. As chance takes the place of Charlie's stunted conscience, his actions and statements become increasingly ugly and abusive while his arrogance, his sense of privilege and his contempt for nearly everyone around him become obvious. Writer and director McMahon raised the financing for Charlie Casanova and recruited most of his cast and crew through postings on Facebook, with the filmmaker claiming it was the first feature film conceived and launched though the use of the social networking site. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"771235289", "runtime"=>94, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Thriller"}]}

But beneath the surface Francois seethes with resentment; as an Afrikaner, he distrusts and dislikes the blacks who have risen to political power since the end of apartheid, and while he's openly homophobic, he's sexually attracted to men and takes part in periodic group sex sessions with other white, married men. While attending his daughter's wedding, Francois sees Christian (Charlie Keegan), the handsome twenty-something son of a longtime family friend, and he quickly becomes obsessed.

As she was growing up, Costa's uncle Rodolfo was always the black sheep of the family -- he was the one who never married, who lived alone, who wanted to be a dancer rather than a laborer, and who wore clothes his brothers thought were inappropriate. It wasn't until Costa became an adult that she realized Rodolfo was gay, and when he was found dead in his home, she began to imagine how Paraguay's oppressive attitudes towards gays and lesbians had impacted him. Under the dictatorial rule of Alfredo Stroessner, gays were harassed by the authorities, their arrests were publicized by the police, and violence against them was commonplace and tolerated. Years later, after a long exile in Spain, Costa finds Paraguay is marginally more tolerant, but few gays or lesbians have the courage to express their sexuality in a place where they're still encouraged to remain in the closet. Costa's film Cuchillo de Palo (aka 108) takes its name from a derogatory name for gays still used in Paraguay, and tells the story of her uncle's life and death while also examining how little circumstances have improved for Paraguay's gay community in the 21st Century. 108 was an official selection at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/61/11156140_det.jpg", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"770873537", "runtime"=>93, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Foreign"}]}

When Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) vanishes into thin air, his brother Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate. Upon reuniting with his estranged father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), however, he discovers a destiny far darker than his blackest nightmares. Ben is dead; the victim of a savage attack by a beast that keeps the superstitious locals cowering in fear every time the moon shines bright in the sky. Shortly after discovering his brother's true fate, Lawrence swears to Ben's wife, Gwen (Emily Blunt), that he will bring her late husband's killer to justice. As a young boy, the untimely death of his mother caused Lawrence to grow up before his time. Though Lawrence had previously attempted to bury his pain in the past by leaving the quiet Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor behind, he discovers that you can't outrun fate when he's attacked by the very same nocturnal beast that claimed his brother. Not even recently arrived Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) can dream up a rational explanation for the gruesome spell cast over Blackmoor, yet rumors of an ancient curse persist. According to legend, the afflicted will experience a horrific transformation by the light of the full moon. Now, the woman Talbot loves is in mortal danger, and in order to protect her he must venture into the moonlit woods and destroy the beast before it destroys her. But this isn't a typical hunt, because before the beast can be slain, a simple man will uncover a primal side of himself that he never knew existed.

But these funny monsters also have a serious side, and may hold the key to helping Momo understand what her father had been trying to tell her.

In time, Helm and his bandmates parted ways with Hawkins to go out on their own, and after a spell as Bob Dylan's backing group they became known as the Band, recording a handful of the most honored rock albums of the 1960s and 70s. When guitarist and songwriter Robbie Robertson decided to break up the Band in 1976, the group's final concert was a major musical event which spawned Martin Scorsese's acclaimed documentary The Last Waltz. But Levon Helm wasn't done with music by a long shot, and in spite of three decades that would have tested any man's patience -- including troubles with drug addiction, unpaid record royalties, bankruptcy, legal skirmishes over the rights to his music, accidentally shooting himself in the leg, the death of two of his closest friends and a battle with throat cancer -- in 2008 Helm had a banner year as he earned a Grammy nomination for his first studio album in years, Dirt Farmer, and was being given a lifetime achievement award by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Filmmaker Jacob Hatley offers an intimate look at a legend of American music as he struggles to keep moving forward against long odds in the documentary Ain't In It For My Health: A Film About Levon Helm, which was an official selection at the 2010 Los Angeles Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif", "release_date"=>nil, "rt_id"=>"770873427", "runtime"=>83, "genres"=>[{:name=>"Documentary"}]}

When Baartma's partnership with Caezar comes to an end, she finds herself working with a French showman, Reaux (Olivier Gourmet), who is even less scrupulous as he parades her before slumming French aristocrats, and later she is at the mercy of Georges Cuvier (Francois Marthouret), a scientist who uses her as part of his vile experiments in hopes of proving Africans are racially inferior.

Young John (Alex Ambrose) is a bright but sharp-tongued boy living in the coastal town of Liverpool during the 1950s with his aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and uncle George (David Threlfall). John's father walked out on the family when he was four years old, and the boy was given to Mimi to raise, even though his mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), was still alive. While Mimi's straight-laced nature runs counter to John's more reckless personality, they clearly love one another and the household is thrown into chaos when George dies suddenly. At the funeral, teenage John (now played by Aaron Johnson) sees Julia, and learns to his surprise that she lives only a few blocks away from Mimi. John pays her a visit, and Julia gratefully welcomes him back into her life. Julia's personality is a much closer fit to John than Mimi, and she encourages his love for writing and music, teaching him to play the banjo. However, John's renewed relationship with Julia brings up a number of unanswered questions, and causes new tensions between Mimi and John. And as rock & roll becomes the hot new sound of the day, John falls in love with the bold new music and makes a friend who is interested in forming a band, Paul (Thomas Brodie Sangster). The first feature film from artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Wood, Nowhere Boy was the closing night attraction at the 2009 BFI London Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/53/11155328_det.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-10-08", "rt_id"=>"770817089", "runtime"=>98, "genres"=>[]}

It's a whimsical fish-out-of-water story of two spoiled sisters: Nora (Camilla Belle), a law student, and Mary (Alexa Vega), an undergrad party girl, living with their father in a luxurious mansion in Beverly Hills. Mary has become so \"90210\" she refuses to admit she is of Mexican descent. When dad suddenly passes away, their posh lives are turned upside down. They discover they have been left penniless and are forced to move into their estranged aunt Aurelia's (Adriana Barraza) modest but lively home in the Latino-centric Boyle Heights neighborhood of East LA. They are terrified to leave their world of privilege; neither Nora nor Mary speak Spanish or have ever had to take on actual responsibility. The girls gradually adapt to their new environment; their BMW and Prius are traded for the public bus and a used car. As they embrace the culture that for so long they refused to accept, they both discover romance, the true meaning of family, and they learn that the life of PRADA actually means NADA without love, family and community.

But is this Alice the same Alice who appears in the scroll? While some of the creatures of Underland have their doubts, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and his friends are certain she's the same girl who previously visited them years ago.
