They were unhappy with the Portuguese rule (Imperials) and started a revolt that lasted ten years, from 1835 to 1845.\n\nThe name of the civil war comes from the Portuguese word \"Farrapos\" which means, ragged or tattered clothing. With the exception of their leaders, who were wealthy land owners, the rebels (lower-class people, slaves, free blacks, and Indians) were poorly dressed, poorly fed and in poor health.\n\nThe historical figures in this mini series include the following: Bento Gonçalves da Silva (Werner Schünemann) - leader of the rebels, Giuseppe Garibaldi (Thiago Lacerda) - an Italian adventurer and revolutionary, Ana Maria de Jesus Ribeiro better known as Anita Garibaldi (Giovanna Antonelli) - a revolutionary and abolitionist, and Manuela Ferreira (Camelia Morgado) - the narrator of the story.\n\nAgainst the background of this war, the story introduces the viewers to seven women (all related to Bento Gonçalves) - Dona Ana Joaquina (eldest sister of Bento Gonçalves), Caetana (wife of Bento Gonçalves), Perpétua (Caetana's daughter), Maria (sister of Bento Gonçalves), Manuela, Rosario, and Mariana (Maria's daughters). Dona Antônia (Jandira Martini), another sister of Bento Gonçalves, is not officially considered part of the \"Sete Mulheres\" (Seven Women) group but deserves a special mention.\n\nWhile the men are away fighting, the women move into one house (Dona Ana Joaquina's house) on a ranch for safety reasons. Each woman has a different personality and absorbing storyline of love, grief, courage, desire, hate, despair, hope, bitterness, and determination.\n\nA CASA DAS SETE MULHERES (The House of the Seven Women) presents a splendid story.

He brought the innovative technique of laying down a ‘skid road’ to his home state of North Carolina after watching it done in Georgia. “My dad couldn’t believe it, but we’d found a way to keep from sinking into the swamp and keep the land underneath in pretty good condition too.\"", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/101671-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2009-06-15", "genres"=>["Reality"]}

Yet like his predecessor Mickey Mouse, Goofy has not remained the same all these years; he has undergone countless changes. In his 1932 debut “Mickey’s Revue”, he first appeared with the name Dippy Dawg, which answers a frequently-asked question, “What is Goofy?” He is a dog, however unlike Pluto, Goofy was granted the anthropomorphic features of walking on two legs, wearing clothes and partaking in “human” activities, like his fellow stars Mickey and Donald. It was his\nlaugh which helped Goofy stand out from the other generic background characters – although it is his yell which many identify with - in the early barnyard shorts, provided by one-time clown Pinto Colvig. Goofy became an instant star and was promoted to appearing alongside Mickey and Donald on many occasions in such classic 1930s shorts as “Clock Cleaners” and “Lonesome Ghosts.”\n\nDespite initially having the official title of Dippy Dawg, to the Disney staff he was always “The Goof.” He demonstrated his Goofy nature by falling victim usually to inanimate objects such as the piano in the 1936 short “Moving Day”, and the shorts would always progress with Goofy trying method after method to achieve his goal, with the methods growing increasingly more farcical. However, due to argument between Walt and Colvig, Colvig left the studio after the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs – for which he had provided two voices – and went to work for Walt’s rival Max Fleischer. Other actors were hired to replicate Colvig’s voice and audio tracks were reused, but it was not the same without him and eventually in 1942 Colvig came back to the Disney studio for good.

{"title"=>"Superman (1941)", "tvdb_id"=>"102621", "rating"=>8.0, "overview"=>"The Superman animated cartoons, commonly but somewhat erroneously known as the \"Fleischer Superman cartoons\" were a series of seventeen animated Technicolor short films, produced by Fleischer Studios from 1941 to 1942 and Famous Studios from 1942 to 1943 and released by Paramount Pictures between 1941 and 1943, based upon the comic book character Superman.\n\nSuperman was Fleischer Studios' final animated series before Famous Studios took over production on September 20, 1942.\n\nThe first nine cartoons were produced by Fleischer Studios (the name by which the cartoons are commonly known). In 1942, Fleischer Studios was dissolved and reorganized as Famous Studios, which produced the final eight shorts. These cartoons are seen as some of the finest, and certainly the most lavishly budgeted, animated cartoons produced during The Golden Age of American animation. In 1994, the series was voted #33 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.\n\nBy mid-1941, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer had recently finished their first animated feature film, Gulliver's Travels, and were deep into production on their second, Mister Bug Goes to Town. They were reluctant to commit themselves to another major project at the time when they were approached by their distributor, and owner since May 1941, Paramount Pictures. Paramount was interested in cashing in on the phenomenal popularity of the new Superman comic books by producing a series of theatrical cartoons based upon the character. The Fleischers hoped to discourage Paramount from committing to the series, so they informed the studio that the cost of producing such a series of cartoons would be about $100,000 per short -- an amazingly high figure, about six times the typical budget of a six-minute Fleischer Popeye the Sailor cartoon during the 1940s.[1] To their surprise, Paramount agreed to a budget of $50,000[2] - half the requested sum, but still three times the cost of the average Fleischer short - , and the Fleischers were committed to the project.\n\nThe first cartoon in the series, simply titled Superman, was released on September 26, 1941, and was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. It lost to Lend a Paw, a Pluto cartoon from Walt Disney Productions and RKO Pictures.\n\nThe Fleischers produced nine cartoons in the Superman series before Paramount took over the Fleischer Studios facility in Miami and ousted Max and Dave Fleischer, due to the fact that the brothers were no longer able to cooperate with each other, and the studio's co-owner Dave Fleischer had left Florida to produce Screen Gems cartoons for Columbia Pictures in California as well. The sleek look of the series continued, but there was a noticeable change in the storylines of the later shorts of the series. The first nine cartoons had more of a science fiction aspect to them, as they involved the Man of Steel fighting robots, giant dinosaurs, meteors from outer space, and other perils. The later eight cartoons in the series dealt more with World War II propaganda stories, such as in Eleventh Hour, which finds Superman going to Japan to commit acts of espionage in order to reduce the morale of the enemy.\n\nRotoscoping, the process of tracing animation drawings from live-action footage, was used extensively to lend realism to the human characters and Superman. Many of Superman's actions, however, could not be rotoscoped (flying, lifting very large objects, and so on). In these cases, the Fleischer lead animators, many of whom were not trained in figure drawing, animated roughly and depended upon their assistants, many of whom were inexperienced with animation but were trained in figure drawing, to keep Superman \"on model\" during his action sequences.\n\nThe first seven cartoons originated the classic opening line which was later adopted by the Superman radio series and in the live-action television series a decade later: \"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!\" However, for the final two of the first nine Fleischer-produced cartoons and first of the eight Famous Studios-produced cartoons, the opening was changed to \"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to soar higher than any plane!\". With the changeover to Famous Studios and the loss of the Fleischers, the opening line of the cartoon series was changed to \"Faster than a streak of lightning! More powerful than the pounding surf! Mightier than a roaring hurricane!\" This series also continued (from the radio series) the use of the now-classic exclamation: \"Up in the sky, look! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!\"\n\nFamous Studios ended the series after a total of seventeen shorts had been produced, replacing it with a series of shorts based upon Marge's Little Lulu. The high cost of the series kept it from continuing in the face of budgetary restrictions that were imposed after removing the Fleischers from the studio. The first cartoon had a budget of $50,000 (equivalent to $1,316,000 today), and the other sixteen each had a budget of $30,000 (equivalent to $789,600 for each of the eight other Fleischer cartoons and $731,111.10 for each of the eight Famous Studios cartoons), bringing the total cost of the series to $530,000 (equivalent to $13,481,688.80 today).[2] In addition, Paramount cited waning interest in the Superman shorts among theater exhibitors as another justification for the series' cancellation.[4]\n\nAll seventeen cartoons were sold to Motion Pictures for Television (producers of the TV series The Adventures of Superman) in 1955, and all eventually fell into the public domain (their copyrights having not been renewed by either Paramount, NTA/Republic, EMKA, Ltd./Universal Studios, or even Motion Pictures for Television and DC Comics), and have been widely distributed on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. Nonetheless, Warner Bros., via parent Time Warner's ownership of DC Comics, now owns the original film elements to the cartoons.\n\nThe voice of Superman for the series was initially provided by Bud Collyer, who also performed the lead character's voice during the Superman radio series. Joan Alexander was the voice of Lois Lane, a role she also portrayed on radio alongside Collyer. Music for the series was composed by Sammy Timberg, the Fleischers' long-time musical collaborator.\n\nA 1944 Famous Studios Popeye the Sailor cartoon entitled She-Sick Sailors parodied the Superman cartoons, two years after production on the cartoons had ceased. In this cartoon, Popeye's enemy Bluto dresses up as Superman to fool Olive Oyl, and he challenges Popeye to feats of super-strength that \"only Superman\" can do. The musical score for She-Sick Sailors includes echoes of Sammy Timberg's Fleischer/Famous Superman score.\n\nIn a rare move for a competing studio, Leon Schlesinger Productions, producers of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies (which were distributed by WB), featured Timberg's Superman theme in Snafuperman, a 1944 Private Snafu cartoon Schlesinger produced for the U.S. Army.\n\nThe Fleischer cartoons were also responsible for Superman being able to fly. When they started work on the series, Superman could only leap from place to place (hence \"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound\" in the opening). But they deemed it as \"silly looking\" after seeing it animated and decided to have him fly instead.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/102621-2.jpg", "release_date"=>"1941-09-26", "genres"=>["Action and Adventure", "Animation", "Children"]}

{"title"=>"Total Drama Action", "tvdb_id"=>"105601", "rating"=>6.0, "overview"=>"Total Drama Action is the second season of the Canadian animated television series Total Drama Island. The show premiered in Teletoon Canada 6:30 et/pt[2] on January 11, 2009. This series was also created by the makers of 6Teen, another Teletoon program.\n\n\nLike its predecessor, Total Drama Island, this season's series is an \"animated reality show\" starring fifteen teenagers. This series still portrays likeliness towards other physical and social shows, like Fear Factor and The Real World. The original twenty-two \"campers\" were cut down to fifteen \"cast-mates\" after the reunion special's dramatic ending between these seasons. Both host and assistant Chris McClean and Chef Hatchet will return as the cast-mates' supervisors and challenge distributors. The theme of this series is \"Cinematography\". These fifteen cast-mates have found out that they will be staying in an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto, Ontario. Since the theme is all about movies, the competitors are treated as real actors. They stay in small, unaccomodating actors' trailers competing against each other and themselves. Challenges come back for this season, as well. Unlike the random TDI challenges, TDA challenges will be based upon which movie genre the cast-mates will portray. The \"mess hall\" of TDI will also be replaced this season with The Craft Services Tent, which will also be catered by Chef Hatchet, once more. The \"outhouse/confession can\" of TDI was used to let the audience at home know what the campers were really thinking about. In TDA, this was replaced with the \"Make-Up Confessional\", a room full of make-up and body enhancements. If the cast-mates were able to make it past Chris, the daily challenge(s), and themselves, their fate would, then, have to be decided. TDI also used the outhouse/confession can to cast votes as to who they would like voted off. Cast-mates of TDA now used \"voting devices\" placed under their seats to vote someone off. The elimination bonfire ceremony was replaced with an \"awards ceremony\", where all but one person would receive a Gilded Chris Statuette (which took the place of the marshmallows). The losers of Total Drama Island had to walk down the Dock of Shame, board the Boat of Losers, and leave the campsite (to go to La Playa De Losers); however, the Total Drama Action losers must walk down the Red Carpet Walk of Shame, get into the Lame-O-Sine, and leave the film lot for good (it is unknown to the viewing world where the losers go). This process is supposed to continue until one cast-mate is left on the film lot. That one cast-mate will, then, take home the $1,000,000 cash prize.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/105601-2.jpg", "release_date"=>"2009-01-11", "genres"=>[]}

His explosive speed, superb physical conditioning, and dynamic competitive spirit should seemingly translate to off-the-field success in love, family and life. But even at the top of his game, something is missing, and this off-season Terrell Owens finds himself a man in transition.\n\nBrash and outspoken, a media magnet, the private Terrell is a low-key introspective native of tiny Alexander City, Alabama who never forgets where he came from. To help reconcile the contradictions in his persona -- he's both \"T.O.,\" a controversial hero to thousands of fans, and \"Terrell Owens,\" a single guy still searching for the right woman - he's taking some time in Los Angeles to chill out, reflect and be closer to his friends. But because his \"T.O.\" side is always present just beneath the surface, things won't stay quiet for long.\n\nTerrell is not on this journey alone. His best friends and publicists, Monique Jackson and Kita Williams, are there every step of the way. They are determined to shepherd their friend and client into success off the field, voicing their very distinct opinions about who Terrell should date, and who he shouldn't, while simultaneously running the \"T.O. brand.\" They also aren't above a little subterfuge to get their way, keeping a close eye on Terrell at red carpet events, gatherings at his house, club openings and even on cruise ships -- never hesitating to pull back the reins and remind him that this off-season is about getting in touch with his inner Terrell.\n\nFrom the dramatic end of his tenure in Dallas to his exciting new chapter in Buffalo, Monique and Kita also encourage Terrell to travel home to Alexander City, Alabama to share a poignant visit with his estranged father. Could this meeting help explain why he is who he is today? And, will it inspire Terrell to rethink his own role as a father?\n\nEmotional, entertaining and most of all revealing, Terrell Owens will expose his personal life as never before, bringing all the drama, energy and heart that only he can bring.

The following year, Sensation as we know it was born. As a tribute to his brother Miles, who helped found ID&T before sadly dying in a car accident, Duncan Stutterheim, Sensation CEO, asked visitors to dress in white as people did at Miles’ funeral.  Numbers had doubled from the first year, and eighty percent of the 40,000 attendees did so, creating an image so staggering that the dress code has remained the same ever since.\n\nWorld-renowned DJs take to the Sensation decks during each eight-hour spectacle of extraordinary stage shows, acrobats, actors, state-of-the-art lightshows, lasers and fireworks. Performers dance across the venue and abseil from the roof, flames shoot from the stage and carnival floats part the crowds.\n\nSome of the worlds best DJs have played Sensation over the years, each helping to take the visitors through the night as the perfect musical accompaniment to the unfolding show, making Sensation what it is today. Tiësto, Sven Vath, Armin van Buuren, Carl Cox, David Guetta, Richie Hawtin, Axwell, Fedde le Grand, Steve Angelo, Sebastian Ingrosso and Erick Morillo have all graced the Sensation stage at some point in their careers, many referring to it the highlight of their careers.\n\nAs Sensation’s reputation has grown, the music has evolved and taken on it’s own style – it’s not just about booking the biggest name DJs anymore, it’s about choosing the people who can make Sensation the best event possible, and play the most cutting edge music of today and tomorrow. Sensation also continually champions the local heroes, the stars of the moment, and the stars of the future, with local DJs always being hand-picked to open or close Sensation in their own countries in front of their home crowds.\n\nBesides the DJs and performers, the renowned Megamix is, for many, an exciting climax of any Sensation show, setting it apart from all other dance events. This moment during every show is when not the DJs, but the music itself, and the public, are the stars. Compiled by one of the musical masterminds of ID&T Sensation, this musical trip through history features a range of old and new classics, accompanied by a spectacular show and fireworks display.\n\nWith a different theme every year - from Space, to the Garden of Eden, and Ocean of White - every single show is completely different. The new theme is launched at the Amsterdam edition each year, before traveling the globe.\n\nSensation has expanded beyond Amsterdam, with shows in countries across Europe including Germany, Belgium, Russia and Poland.

It starred Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson, Maurice Roëves, Richard Wilson and Katy Murphy. It brought many of the cast to national prominence.\n\nThe Majestics, a legendary Scots rock 'n' rollband, are on the eve of their 1986 \"Silver Jubilee\" tour, and find themselves in trouble when their lead singer, Big Jazza McGlone, is killed in a car crash.\n\nThe group's devious and exploitative manager Eddie Clockerty (Wilson) talks Big Jazza's younger brother, Danny (Coltrane), home from New York for the funeral, into joining the band as their new lead singer. Suzi Kettles (Thompson), a sharp cookie and old classmate of Danny, picks up the guitar and also joins the band. From that moment the ill-fated tour and the band's fortunes appear to take a turn for the better.\n\nThe series is a sharply-written and very black comedy. The Majestics' final dispiriting tour of Scotland's less salubrious clubs and pubs is punctuated by childish backstage squabbling and a series of personal disasters. Ageing heart-throb Vincent Diver (Roëves), 'the iron man of Scottish Rock', is cheating on his wife Noreen (a community nurse and sister of drummer Bomba) with girlfriend Glenna (played by Fiona Chambers as simultaneously pathetic, manipulative and glutinously cloying), who has an apparent pregnancy and when it is proved to be false commits suicide by jumping from a bridge into the Clyde. Vincent is also knifed in Buckie by a girl who believes she is his illegitimate daughter from a one-night stand on a tour of long ago. Suzi Kettles proves to have an abusive ex-partner, a dentist, who is eventually given his comeuppance in the dentist's chair by Danny. The fractious on-off relationship between rotund Danny McGlone and Suzi adds a further comic dimension, along with the 'double-act' of the dour Mr Clockerty and his lippy secretary Janice Toner (Murphy).

Furthermore, Mossadegh is depicted as a democrat while he, in fact, ruled as an eccentric populist leader and he contemplated the prospect of restoring Sharia law.

{"title"=>"The History of Safari with Richard E Grant", "tvdb_id"=>"162091", "rating"=>7.0, "overview"=>"For almost 100 years, big game hunters - from Theodore Roosevelt to the British Royal Family - came to British East Africa to bag the 'big five'. Now, luxury 'eco safaris' continue to drive its economy. It has been both East Africa's damnation and its salvation, that wildlife is the greatest natural resource it possesses.\n\nRichard E Grant - who grew up in Swaziland - examines the controversial history of the safari. Exploring the world of the big game hunters and the luxury of today's safaris, he goes on a personal journey to experience how the beauty of the bush made Africa the white man's playground.\n\nPlotting the major landmarks in the development of the safari, Grant uncovers a world of danger, glamour and gung-ho. He reveals how the safari was continually reinvented as explorers and ivory hunters were replaced by white settlers, guns gave way to cameras and direct British rule to independence.\n\nHe discovers how safari became one of the central constructs through which British rule over East Africa was imposed, provided the social touchstone for the white settlers and was eventually transformed by the glamour of Hollywood, the power of the dollar and the traveller's desire for an 'authentic African experience'.\n\nAs someone born and raised in the privileged world of the ex-pats, Grant takes an insider's perspective on the scandals and adventures of the elite class of Brits who ran the show. He meets their descendents and delves into the rich material archives of their family homes, discovering that for the remaining whites in the region this history is still very much alive.\n\nAs the trophy hunt became an icon of high society, everyone from Ernest Hemingway to British nobility and Hollywood stars were soon clamouring for a piece of the action. And as hunters decimated Africa's wildlife, they also surprisingly introduced the first conservation laws, if only to protect the supply of animals to shoot.\n\nEmbarking on safari himself, Grant experiences the beauty and the danger of being up close to the big game animals and accompanies modern hunters on safaris, where animals are still killed and the patrons still argue that hunting equals conservation.\n\nThe film is full of frontier colonial characters whose lives, exploits and attitudes describe a very particular time in Britain's relationship to Africa and its wildlife, when the continent was part Wild West, part idyll and part colonial experiment - where life could be lived between the crack of rifles at dawn and the setting of the sun at cocktail hour, largely oblivious to the indigenous Africans themselves.\n\nThrough creative use of film and photographic archive, as well as actuality with those involved in big game hunting and luxury safaris today, the documentary evokes the spirit of decadence, exploration and adventure of the safari. Ultimately, it reveals how safari has been and continues to be a barometer of our attitudes to travel, our colonial inheritance and Africa itself.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/162091-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-04-28", "genres"=>["Documentary", "Special Interest"]}

{"title"=>"Don Chuck Beaver", "tvdb_id"=>"175991", "rating"=>8.0, "overview"=>"The adventures of a beaver pup and his friends in the forest of Clairefontaine.  In 1975, 26 episodes were produced by Knack Productions in Japan, under the title, 'Don Chuck Monogatari'.  The following year -- in 1976 -- another 76 episodes were produced by Knack under the title, 'Shin Don Chuck Monogatari'.  Of the 99, 53 made up the French Canadian (Quebec) version dubbed by Bellevue Pathe in the 1980's.  Known in French as 'Le Petit Castor', it aired on Teletoon Retro (Francais) in Canada in April 2009 until late February 2012.\n\n\n\nPlot\n\n\n\nCastor lives in the forest of Clairefontaine with his father -- his mother died when he was a baby.  He misses his mother terribly and his love for her is reflected through his looking into the sky and 'talking' to her, resulting in a vision of the deceased, usually in the moon during the night.  Family relationships are more often than not a focus of the series, through reunions, finding lost relatives and conflicts between family and friends, the latter sometimes resulting in a character running away from home.  Happily, these situations end on a positive note.\n\n\n\nMeet The Characters\n\n\n\nCastor: \"He is small, but he is so strong!\"  This is the story of Castor, a carefree beaver pup living in the forest of Clairefontaine.  Castor is always willing to give anyone a hand and his curious nature leads into many adventures with his friends.  But Castor is still young and sometimes the adventures and questions can be quite a lot for his father to handle.  \n\n\n\nLily: One of Castor's best friends, Lily usually accompanies Castor on many of his adventures.  A good-natured beaver pup, Lily can also be found helping out her mother at home or picking the most beautiful flowers.  Dressed in red from bow to toes, Lily's wish is to be a princess who dances and sings, or to at least meet one someday!  \n\n\n\nNounours (pronounced noo-nurse) (in English, teddy bear): When Castor isn't hanging around with Lily, he can be found with best friend Nounours.  What this bear cub lacks in courage, he more than makes up for in feats of strength for someone so young when he and Castor are on an adventure.  Nounours is usually found along the river trying to catch the big one -- he's a bear who loves to fish almost as much as he loves to eat!  \n\n\n\nMimi:  A pleasant lilac bunny rabbit, Mimi can be found from time to time with Castor, Lily and Nounours on their adventures.  Mimi somtimes finds herself in trouble even though her intentions are good.  She is likely to fall for or in a trap and is eventually rescued by Castor.  Mimi also tends to worry whenever there is a threat, but her parents and friends are there to comfort and reassure her that everything will be all right.\n\n\n\nGarou (pronounced gah-roo) (in English, werewolf):  Garou is a wolf who is the chief troublemaker in Clairefontaine.  He is jealous of Castor and his popularity and is usually challenging him in verbal confrontations or physical contests -- mostly on the losing end.  On occasion, there is a good side to Garou, but only if he is rewarded in the form of a dessert, nuts or other food (cakes and cookies are his favourite)!  \n\n\n\nFinaud (pronounced fee-noh) (in English, sly, cunning):  One of Garou's sidekicks, this sly fox is the eyes and ears for Garou to let him know what Castor and his friends are up to.  But Finaud also dreams of being the 'king' of Clairefontaine -- similar to Garou.  At times, he becomes the target of physical punishment from Castor, before Castor's father stops him.  \n\n\n\nLourdaud (pronounced loor-doh) (in English:  clumsy, oaf):  Garou's other sidekick is Lourdaud the badger.  If nothing else, he loves to play with his 'claquettes' (tap sticks)!  Lourdaud is faithful to Garou, but lacks the strength and cleverness for his plans to work out.  \n\n\n\nAristotle:  Castor's father finds taking care of his son is a handful.  Between trying to raise his son on his own and helping him during his adventures, Mr. Castor is known for his philosophical views on life and his interest in science and the environment.  Castor's father also loves to read -- now if he could just Castor to read a little more often!  \n\n\n\nChristina: Lily's mother. She Is a good friend to Mr. Castor, similar to the friendship Lily experiences with Castor.  She is very kind and appreciates the help from her daughter and is able to lend an ear to Castor and Nounours.  \n\n\n\nDr. Bouc (pronounced book) (in English, goat): In addition to being a doctor, he is also the forest elder who is looked up to for his wisdom.  When Mr. Castor needs to know what to do or have a question answered, he usually goes to Dr. Bouc for advice.  The two are very good friends.  \n\n\n\nMargot (pronounced like Margo):  Nounours' mother.  Nounours' mother is good-hearted, but is strict when it comes to raising Nounours.  Even when her son is telling the truth, she sometimes doesn't believe him to the point of calling him silly or punishing him.  \n\n\n\nOscar:  Garou's stubborn grandfather, whose relationship with Mr. Castor is similar to that between Castor and Garou.  Often ridicules Mr. Castor's scientific research and makes light of any warnings the senior Castor has for the animals of Clairefontaine regarding a danger resulting from an act of Nature.  \n\n\n\nFifi:  Also known as Fute (foo-tay, meaning in English: 'smarty').  This little kangaroo lives up to her nickname and she'll only be too happy to tell you herself!  Nicknamed 'Smarty' by her friends, Fifi is probably the only animal in Clairefontaine with a map of the world to go with her many books -- a world Castor and the others can only dream of.  She proves to be more than capable of handling the scheming Garou, but there are times where she is too smart for her own good.  \n\n\n\nNatasha:  Castor's deceased mother.  She died when Castor was just a baby, leaving Castor's father to take care of him.  When his father is unable to help him, Castor looks to the sky to ask his mother's spirit to guide him.\n\n\nOther Characters:\n\n\nTirelaine (pronounced teer-len):  A leopard who as a bandit, threatened to harm Castor, Lily and Nounours as they searched for a plant to help an ill Finaud.  He changed his ways after Castor made good on a promise to deliver the plant to Finaud and return to rescue Lily and Nounours before sundown.  Tirelaine becomes a friend of Castor and later rescues him and his father from a trio of bandits who kick them out of their home and move in.\n\n\n*Pappy:  Fifi's baby brother.  Fifi is excited when Pappy is born, wanting to be a 'big sister', but learns parenting is a big responsibility when Pappy has to be rescued after being abducted during the night.  This adorable joey -- baby kangaroo -- is the apple of his mother's eye and is happy to meet anyone, even Garou...as long as he doesn't take him away!  \n\n\n\n*not shown in Quebec/Canada.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/175991-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2009-04-06", "genres"=>["Animation", "Children"]}

{"title"=>"Great Migrations", "tvdb_id"=>"197371", "rating"=>7.6, "overview"=>"Great Migrations gives the word “move” a whole new meaning. This seven-part global programming event takes viewers around the world on the arduous journeys millions of animals undertake to ensure the survival of their species. Shot from land and air, in trees and cliff-blinds, on ice floes and underwater, the shows tell the powerful stories of many of the planet’s species and their movements, while revealing new scientific insights with breathtaking high-definition clarity and emotional impact. The beauty of these stories is underscored by a new focus into these species’ fragile existence and their life-and-death quest for survival in an ever-changing world.\nThe National Geographic Great Migrations team spent two and a half years in the field, traveling 420,000 miles across 20 countries and all seven continents to bring this ambitious production to television. Seven hours in total, Great Migrations includes four core hours chronicling epic animal migration, narrated by two-time Emmy, three-time Golden Globe winner Alec Baldwin. Additional hours include a special on scientific investigation of the mysteries of animal migration; a behind-the-scenes special on the advanced technology, dramatic challenges and passion required to capture these spectacular events; and an hour-long visual concert comprised of the stunning footage set to original music.\nA global initiative unprecedented in the Society's storied 122-year history, Great Migrations content will also be featured across the spectrum of National Geographic platforms, including magazine articles and maps, books, DVDs, mobile and iPhone apps, games, lectures, screenings, exhibits and tours, among others.\nGreat Migrations reveals new scientific insight, previously undocumented behaviors and the most indepth visual record of a diverse range of animal migrations, including Botswana zebras, Mali elephants, red crabs on Christmas Island (between Australia and Indonesia), flying foxes in Australia, army ants in Costa Rica and Pacific great white sharks. It's a technical tour de force capturing the travels of microscopic ocean plankton and translucent jellyfish and documenting the attachment of radio transmitters to monarch butterflies and elephant seals to study their migration behaviors. Each animal’s fragile, yet majestic, existence will inspire viewers to consider what it is really like to move like your life depends on it.\nThe films reveal in detail animal behaviors never before caught on film, including the dramatic moment a herd of Mali elephants pass through the “La Porte des Elephants” – the elephants’ door – in West Africa, and a monarch butterfly flying with a radio transmitter attached. Off the coast of Guadalupe Island, observe rarely seen behavior as a great white shark devours a seal. Also see the unusual footage of a zebra stallion as he tries to herd an orphaned foal. Witness history as massive numbers of white-eared kob of the Sudan, thought to have been wiped out during more than two decades of violent unrest, are filmed for the first time, as well as a heartbreaking crisis for Arctic walruses confronting historic climate change.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/197371-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-11-07", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}
