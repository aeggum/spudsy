{"title"=>"Strumpet City", "tvdb_id"=>"203951", "rating"=>10.0, "overview"=>"Covering the years between 1907 and 1914, Strumpet City follows several characters through the nightmare years of the \"Dublin Lockout,\" when the Catholic Church sided with the industrialists to smash Irish labor's first substantive steps towards unionizing. \n\nUsing the real-life labor organizer Jim Larkin (Peter O'Toole) as the dramatic lynchpin for the various stories, Strumpet City juggles several storylines to give an overall view of the terrible poverty and misery that afflicted the working poor of Dublin. The central story revolves around Mary (Angela Harding), a young domestic who comes to work for the wealthy, oblivious Bradshaws (Edward Byrne and Daphne Carroll). Once Mary meets handsome, kind foundry worker \"Fitz\" Fitzpatrick (Bryan Murray), she immediately falls in love, and the couple make plans to save enough money to eventually marry. \n\nMary, distressed at the way the Bradshaws shuttle off their devoted housekeeper Miss Gilchrist (Mairin D. O'Sullivan) to the poor house when she can no longer work, decides to leave the insensitive Bradshaw household and marry Fitz.\n\nUnfortunately, historic events conspire to make the young couple's life one of continued want and anxiety. Fitz's involvement with the union frequently keeps him out of work, when he and his fellow workers go out on strikes. And once he works his way up to being foreman of the foundry, he's suddenly caught between the obligations of his new job (and to his employers), and with his union brothers who expect him to walk out with him. \n\nThe other main story of Strumpet City involves the difficult path of Father O'Connor (Frank Grimes), a snobbish Catholic priest who, in a misguided attempt to ease his conscience, leaves his wealthy parish to work among Dublin's most wretched tenement houses. Utterly unsuited to work among the poor (for whom he has a barely concealed disgust), Father O'Connor is greeted with open scorn by his superior, Father Giffley (Cyril Cusack), a troubled alcoholic who has spent too much time among the poor -- the poor who can't be helped with spiritual guidance alone. \n\nFather O'Connor's friend, Protestant businessman Mr. Yearling (Denys Hawthorne), frequently challenges O'Connor on his beliefs and where his sympathies lie - which is almost always with the factory owners and with the well-to-do.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/203951-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"1980-11-07", "genres"=>["Drama", "Mini-Series"]}

{"title"=>"Beyond Scared Straight", "tvdb_id"=>"219331", "rating"=>9.0, "overview"=>"Beyond Scared Straight is a new series executive produced by Arnold Shapiro and based on his Academy Award and multiple Emmy-Winning documentary \"Scared Straight!,\" that will profile unique approaches to juvenile crime prevention in prisons around the U.S.\n\n\"Scared Straight!\" has become an iconic name and a cultural phenomenon over the years. The film made a huge impact - showcasing the radical and effective juvenile intervention program that took place in a New Jersey prison. Since they were created, both the prison program and the film have turned countless kids away from drugs, violence and crime. The power of the original \"Scared Straight!\" program has inspired dozens of inmate-run intervention programs in men's and women's prisons across the country; and this series will showcase several of them. Under the auspices of Arnold Shapiro, \"Beyond Scared Straight\" profiles the new approach to keeping today's kids from becoming tomorrow's convicts.\n\nMuch like the original version of \"Scared Straight!,\" these youthful offender programs put boys and girls of all ethnicities, ranging in age from 13-18, into intensive one-day in-prison sessions that show them the realities of life behind bars. However, in many dramatic ways, these 21st Century programs are very different from the original because today's youth needs a different approach. For current teens, city streets can be as dangerous as the life they believe exists behind bars. TV, film and music have glorified the gang and prison experience and the task of \"scaring\" teens is more complicated now than ever. As a result, inmates have had to adapt their methods - making them more a combination of intimidation, information and communication - and the results for the new program have proven to be equally effective.\n\nEach 60-minute episode of \"Beyond Scared Straight\" will focus on a different prison program in the U.S., following 4 -5 at-risk teens. Viewers will follow them as they attend the program, experience their intensive one-day in-prison session and then follow up with them one-month later to see the lasting impressions the program has left on them.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/219331-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2011-01-13", "genres"=>["Reality"]}

He is the head of a unit of six people: Harun, Hayalet (English: Ghost), Akbaba (English: Vulture), Selim, Cevdet and Eda. They usually work together with the public prosecuter Esra. They chase criminals with perseverance and solve murders and other crimes that occur in Ankara.\n \nBehzat Ç. graduated from the Police academy in 1985. He does not care much about his superiors -not even laws in some cases; he only follows his inner conscience. This often brings him troubles: Even though he graduated from the Police Academy many years ago, he is still stuck in the same position for years unlike his colleagues who are at the peak of their career, because of numerous suspensions and reprimands he got.\n \nAfter an unsuccessful marriage, he is not confident with women. The only woman he seems to care about is his daughter Berna. He is shattered when his daughter is found dead which looks like a case of suicide at first glance. He and his team go on a mission to solve her murder. During the ordeal, he becomes close to his ex wife but she turns down the relationship. He gets in a relationship with a club singer Gönül and then becomes interested in public proescuter Esra. The main suspicion falls on a flamboyant mob boss and businessman Ercüment Çözer who is tracked down successfully by Behzat Ç but escapes abroad using his political connections.\n \nTraumas that he goes through in his private life affect his work directly. On the last episode of the first season Behzat Ç. found out that the murderer of his daughter is Sule, who has been living with Behzat for months. Sule also confessed to Behzat that he is her real father. Final episode of the first season has been considered the best season final of a TV show by the Turkish media.\n", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/235881-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2010-09-19", "genres"=>["Action and Adventure", "Drama"]}

South is a cardinal point on a compass and Southland has become a cardinal point in Lush's life. Moving to the region six years ago was a transformative process for him.\n\nWhile work introduced him to the area, the southern terrain, isolation and history, captured his imagination.  In this seven-part series Lush delivers personal perspectives on the grit, charm, and heart that makes up the fabric of the South.\n\nFrom the moment he leaves his home in Bluff, he is engaged in an epic adventure of land, air and sea, of innovation, evolution and conservation.  From Lush's sleepover at the Dog Island lighthouse and his discoveries of the lighthouse keepers and shipwrecks in our past through to sharing a Stewart Island tepee with Robin, a hippy who has set up a unique home stay and Tim Te Aika, who ran one of the most remote sheep farms in the country in Masons Bay, the characters and stories are the stuff great nations are built on.\n\nThere are remarkable discoveries on any journey but the South has kept its surprises well hidden, like Southlander Herbet Pither who may have been the first person in New Zealand and possibly the world, to fly and Peanut, the finder of this country's largest piece of space junk.  Lush also discovers a man called Ken Tustin who shares his thoughts on the possibilities of wild moose still living in Fiordland and he meets Kim Hollows, a chopper pilot who has been so overwhelmed by Fiordland's beauty, he risked everything to make a film about it.\n\nIt wouldn't be an exploration of the South and its epic terrain without testing a few personal limits.  Lush naturally walks the Milford Track and competes in the 99th annual Tuatapere Sports Day.  He tries his pioneering spirit on a bush-crashing trek from Waitutu Lodge to Puysegar Lighthouse. He also joins the Milford Wanderer on a rough ride around Preservation inlet, Dusky Sound and Doubtful Sound.\n\nSouth doesn't skirt around the more controversial points on the map.  Lush's visit to the Manapouri Dam where he talks to Tim Shadbolt about what it was like to work on the controversial scheme and he shares the story of Amy Bock, New Zealand's most infamous Con Woman fraudster, who posed as a man and married a woman at Nugget Point.\n\nAnd then of course there is the other star of the show, South itself.

And then, of course, there is the other star of the show -- the South itself.

{"title"=>"Al Reinert - For All Mankind ", "tvdb_id"=>"255224", "rating"=>10.0, "overview"=>"In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy's challenge of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\". No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert's documentary For All Mankind is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences. Forty years after the first moon landing, it remains the most radical, visually dazzling work of cinema yet made about this earthshaking event.\n\nThe heroic, historic Apollo moon missions that put human beings on the moon are boiled down, expertly capsulated, and presented as one in Al Reinert's \"For All Mankind\". By editing together bits and pieces from the nine Apollo missions that were launched between 1968 and 1972 (as well as a few shots from later Gemini missions), director Al Reinert has fabricated a stirring and ultimately poignant saga of passion, perseverance, and power and remains one of the most engrossing documentaries of human endeavor and achievement ever committed to film. Criterion released the film years ago (it's #54 in their series), but this is a brand new high definition transfer. It is not to be missed.\nMuch of the footage in this compelling documentary has never before been seen, previous network television and film documentary seeming to dwell on the same few pieces of historic footage only. Thus, from the very start there is a freshness and vivacity to the imagery that's immediately captivating. To keep concentration fully focused on the images, there are no subtitles identifying the various astronauts or missions (though the Criterion disc does has a switch that the viewer can turn on to identify the persons on-screen if he wishes). And thus, the mission with its breathtakingly powerful launch, the fun in space, the snafus, the moon escapades (including some mishaps there as well which could have been life threatening), and the return trip are all captured in a variety of color and black and white footage that is simply amazing.\nReinert also doesn't use the talking heads approach to documentary filmmaking. The astronauts' voices are heard on the soundtrack describing their movements, their memories, their joys and fears during the flight, but there is never anything inserted to draw attention away from the film footage which, in the director's opinion, deserves to be seen without interruption. His decisions were certainly right on the money, too, because the film is as moving and impressive as it's possible for such a short, concise film to be. The achievement of reaching the moon in less than a decade after President Kennedy threw down the gauntlet in 1961 still seems unbelievable, and when one remembers all of the civil unrest that our country went through in the years leading up to Armstrong's unforgettable \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" declaration, the accomplishment today seems even more fantastic.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/255224-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"1989-11-01", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}

David goes back to his roots in Leicestershire, where he hunted for fossils as a child, and where another schoolboy unearthed a significant find in the 1950s. And he revisits Cambridge University, where both he and Darwin studied, and where many years later the DNA double helix was discovered, providing the foundations for genetics.\nAt the end of his journey in the Natural History Museum in London, David concludes that Darwin's great insight revolutionised the way in which we see the world. We now understand why there are so many different species, and why they are distributed in the way they are. But above all, Darwin has shown us that we are not set apart from the natural world, and do not have dominion over it. We are subject to its laws and processes, as are all other animals on earth to which, indeed, we are related.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/259105-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2009-02-01", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}

{"title"=>"The Voyage of Emperor Qian Long to Jiang Nan", "tvdb_id"=>"262860", "rating"=>5.0, "overview"=>"The story was set in the Qing Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Qian Long in 1740. It started off when Emperor Qian Long was young. At the time there was a cult (the Sun-moon cult) that wanted to revolt against him. It attempted to assassinate him and bombed the palace as well. Everyone was panicking, even the Empress Dowager and Empress. Zi Xia, who was the adopted daughter of the cult leader, fought with the Emperor in an attempt to kill him, but his bodyguard saved him. When she fought with another palace guard he unmasked her, and to everyone's surprise, she looked just like the Empress.\n\nThe assassination failed and the Emperor was very mad. He ordered for all his officials to find out about the cult and destroy them. He was so mad that he even scolded his beloved Empress. Out of all his wives and concubines I felt that he loved the Empress most, so that showed how mad he was. Later he found out that the Empress was pregnant and was extremely happy. He decided to go to Jiang Nan and promised her that he would take her as well. Then all of a sudden the Empress mysteriously died after she drank some medicine. The Emperor was again mad. He ordered for the doctor to be executed as he was the one who prescribed the medicine. He even ordered for the jailing of the 2 maids that served the Empress. The Emperor was gravely upset over his Empress' death and kept reminiscing about their past together. Shortly afterwards, he ordered for the release of the 2 maids. One of them had a flashback to the day the Empress died and held in her hands evidence against the murderer, so she was killed. The Emperor then got over his Empress' death and decided to continue with his idea of going to Jiang Nan.\n\nQian Long left the palace to go to Jiang Nan and he took with him a trustworthy and old minister, his bodyguard (Mao Yu Feng), and the other Empress's maid, Lian Er (Liu Wei). To disguise himself, he used the fake name, Gau Tin Sze. Along his travel to Jiang Nan, he met two other people and they joined him with his adventures. One of them was Xiao Yu (Yuki Hsu), and the other was Gu Zi Jie (Jia Yi Ping). They were the hilarious ones that made us laugh the most. The six of them experienced many things together. They went through a lot of things, such as Tin Sze being discovered as the Emperor, money shortage, being jailed and more. Zi Xia arrived at Bao-Ding Province in search for Gu Zi Jie, who was a Ming Dynasty nobleman hoping to rebel again. She rescued him and Tin Sze from the jail cell, and when Tin Sze saw Zi Xia, it was love at first sight, mostly because she looked like his dead Empress. He constantly tried to woo her, but she continually resisted, causing many funny scenes. There were also many other things that happened between his companions, but I didn't understand much of what happened, so I won't go into much detail as compared to the relationship between Tin Sze and Zi Xia.\n\nZi Xia started to develop feelings for Tin Sze as well. Both were oblivious to one another's identities. Some members of the cult knew Tin Sze's identity and wanted to kill him. He was hit by a poisonous weapon on the arm and was luckily saved by Zi Xia. He was badly hurt and because of the poison, he was very cold. Added with the rain and leaking roof, matters were worsened. In order to save him, Zi Xia used her body heat to keep him warm for the night. I don't think anything more happened though.\n\nAs the story progressed, more things happened in their relationship. Zi Xia's brother, Zhong Liang (Yang Chao), was madly in love with her and attempted to kill Tin Sze many times, but Zi Xia was always there to save him. There was also this one time when her father asked her to marry his son, and after much talk she agreed. However, things didn't turn out as planned; on the wedding day Zi Xia objected to getting changed and left. Love also blossomed between Lian Er and the bodyguard and with Xiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie. Soon after, Zi Xia's brother couldn't help it and told her that Gau Tin Sze was actually Emperor Qian Long (as he somehow found out). Zi Xia was very shocked and hurt about what she heard. She was very loyal to her father, and due to it, she agreed to act as an inside spy for him.\n\nThere was an attack where Tin Sze and the others were staying, and his bodyguard was killed, leaving Lian Er greatly heartbroken. Zi Xia found out about it and went to find them, hoping Tin Sze was ok. She reached the bodyguard's grave and saw Tin Sze there, all safe and sound, making her very relieved. Finally Tin Sze told her that he was the Emperor, oblivious to fact that she already knew. He took her into the palace and Lian Er served as her maid. Their relationship grew deeper. They broke through the many barriers in their way, including the Emperor's concubines, who were fighting for the position of Empress, since the Empress was dead. The only barrier that couldn't be broken was the fact that he was the Munchurian Emperor, and she was a Han, in a cult whose primary goal was to bring down the Qing Empire. Zi Xia was constantly reminded of who she was and who he was, causing great disturbance within her.\n\n\nThere were times when Zi Xia wanted to leave Qian Long, causing great pain between the couple. As the story neared the end, things start to get more complicated. Zi Xia was extremely frustrated with her situation. Turmoil built within her and to get rid of the pain, she drank. When she was drunk, she met with her brother, and he tried to rape her, taking advantage of the situation. However, to her luck, before he could do anything, Lian Er came in. Qian Long also arrived and fought off her brother. On that same night, Zi Xia cried to Qian Long about her worries, though not knowing about her brother's intentions, and spent the night with him. At night they were a loving couple, but by morning they were enemies again. The next morning Zi Xia woke and left the Emperor, making him extremely furious.\n\nZi Xia went back to her father, probably to say sorry as she did the wrong thing by sleeping with her enemy. She said something that greatly displeased him and he ordered for her to kill herself, even though he really didn't want to, as he had always treated her as his own daughter. To me, it seemed that she wanted to repay her father for her wrongdoings, as she picked up the sword that lay on the ground, preparing to kill herself. Her life was not to end that way. Just when she raised the sword to her neck, her brother flicked it out of her hand. He greatly loved her, and despite knowing she loved someone else, he still begged his father for her life. At that one scene, I think her father made her join in as part of the revolution, to kill Emperor Qian Long, the man she loved so deeply.\n\nThen there was to be an end to all the problems that arose, so the cult finally decided on a day for the revolution, which was set on the day of the Annual Fireworks. The members of the cult attempted to assassinate the Emperor; however, they still failed (as we should expect already). Qian Long brought with him a gun and his gun troops as well. Everyone was captured making him pleased, but things all turned around when a sword was placed to his neck. What made matters worse, was the person that held the sword was Zi Xia. They had a short talk and he told her that if she didn't kill him, he would kill her. Her love for him was very strong, making her drop the sword, saying she couldn't do it, even though knowing that she'd just dug her own grave by doing so.\n\nDue to Zi Xia's actions that occurred in front of so many people she had to be executed. Qian Long loved her so much that he didn't want her to die. He went to her jail cell and urged her to run away. He even pulled her out of the cell and pointed to the exit, telling her to run for it, but she refused. She didn't want to run as she wanted to repay him for all he had given her. I didn't understand what they said, but their acting must have been great, because I cried heaps.\n\nThe next scene was the day of the execution. Zi Xia stood on the podium, both her hands tied up to the poles. She stood there and had flashbacks about her and the Emperor. The time finally came; the judge threw the stick to the ground. The three of them (Zi Xia, Zhong Liang and their father) were untied and their heads were placed on the chopping board. Zi Xia watched painfully as her brother and father died right in front of her very eyes. It was then Zi Xia's turn. She had more flashbacks to her times with the Emperor as tears rolled down her eyes (and mine too). She looked to the audience and there the Emperor's minister and Gu Zi Jie were at the back, singing her a song. She took another glance elsewhere, and there she saw Tin Sze for the last time, and the executioner's sword came down towards her neck then, the screen blanked out. It is unclear whether she died or not.\n\n\nXiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie left the palace to live happily ever after, together. Two years later, Qian Long decided to visit Jiangnan again with Lian Er and the minister. He saw Xiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie, who had two children and were advertising something. It was a festival of some sort; there were fireworks and lion dancers. As he was enjoyably watching the lion dancers, one of them took off their head costume, and there, right in front of his eyes, stood Zi Xia. They stood face to face and as she smiled at him and he smiled back. However so, it is unclear whether or not it was Zi Xia, whether or not it was an illusion.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/262860-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"2003-09-30", "genres"=>["Documentary", "Drama"]}

{"title"=>"Kung Fu Master From Guangdong", "tvdb_id"=>"262865", "rating"=>6.0, "overview"=>"Kung Fu Master From Guangdong\" is a TV series from either a Taiwanese company, TVB, or a collaboration of both, starring Felix Wong Yut Wah, Leung Jay, and Lau Kam Ling. Felix Wong plays legendary hero, Wong Kei Ying, the father of the notorious Wong Fei Hong while Leung Jay plays Tin Wai Nam, his lover. Lau Kam Ling plays the daughter, Sung Yee Man, of a wealthy father, and is also in love with Wong Kei Ying. \"Kung\" is a series that suffers not only from a one-dimensional script that is now outdated, but also the dubbing of everyone's voices is quite a downside for those who are used to the original voices of the actors.\n\n\n\"Kung's\" story is cliche of old martial arts series where the main character usually holds morally and ideally rigid notions against corrupt government officials. Perhaps because there has been too many of those films recounting these stories, especially of Wong Fei Hong's and Wong Kei Ying's lives, out there that in order for \"Kung\" to succeed, it must provide fresh material--namely, tell the story in a different light. Instead, it chose a well-travelled path that sheds no viewieng value--a plot about one hero who has good martial skills and naturally uses it to do heroic deeds (without ever asking, \"why do heroic deeds?\" -- from Jin Yong in \"Heavenly Sword\"), to fend for the common people, fight off an evil cult (remember Jet Li's films?), and somehow attracts the interest of all the main female characters. The villains are also dramatically so bad that they deserve to die. Aside from plot failures, the impression one gets from the characters are not too ideal. While Felix Wong is a great actor, the role of the young Wong Kei Ying definitely does not fit him as it is strainingly obvious to the sight that Felix is getting old. His father, at most times, looks like he could be his older brother. Performances by Leung Jay and Lau Kam Ling are passable but seemed strained at times.\n\nThe fighting choreography though, is not bad and one might be appeased by some fight scenes. However, the ending of \"Kung\" is a gag. \"Kung\", at best, should have been a movie that should last only a few hours because the story was dragged out for the long run when it was certainly meant for the short, in terms of attention span.", "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/262865-1.jpg", "release_date"=>"1999-01-01", "genres"=>["Action and Adventure"]}
