{"title"=>"Friend, Our Legend", "overview"=>"Friend, Our Legend is a drama adaptation of the 2001 gangster classic film \"Friend\" both by the same director, Kwak Kyung Taek. This drama is a gritty, brilliant, star-studded tale of four childhood friends who grow up to become enemies and bitter rivals. Pretty-boy actor Hyun Bin, turning increasingly to \"serious\" dramas ever since his breakout role in the smash hit My Name is Kim Sam-Soon, brings his thespian skills to a new role as a hardened mobster, a role legendized by Jang Dong Gun in the film.\n\nLee Joon Suk (Kim Min Joon of Tazza), Han Dong Soo (Hyun Bin), Jung Sang Taek (Suh Do Young of Spring Waltz) and Lee Shi Un (Kim Joong Ho) grow up together on the harsh streets of 70s and 80s Busan. Joon Suk and Han Dong Soo soon emerge as leaders, and the four spend every waking moment together, protecting each other, and grow up to be light-hearted teenage delinquents with a distaste for authority.\n\nFast-forward years later, and that distaste for authority remains, but in a much more dangerous form; now Joon Suk and Dong Soo are leaders of rival mob gangs, and Sang Taek and Joong Ho are caught up in a life of crime. Caught between childhood ties and current loyalties, each one will have to choose whether or not to betray their childhood friends. Min Jin Hye of How to Meet a Perfect Neighbour co-stars as Choi Jin Sook, a woman who knew them all as children, and now watches them tear each other apart.\n\nTightly written and gripping, Friend, Our Legend is a spare, elegant drama that effortlessly emerges as a classic gangster story, just as its film counterpart has done. It is highlighted by compelling performances and a beautiful attention to detail. Don't miss out on this tragic epic.

The central story revolves around Mary (Angela Harding), a young domestic who comes to work for the wealthy, oblivious Bradshaws (Edward Byrne and Daphne Carroll). Once Mary meets handsome, kind foundry worker \"Fitz\" Fitzpatrick (Bryan Murray), she immediately falls in love, and the couple make plans to save enough money to eventually marry. \n\nMary, distressed at the way the Bradshaws shuttle off their devoted housekeeper Miss Gilchrist (Mairin D. O'Sullivan) to the poor house when she can no longer work, decides to leave the insensitive Bradshaw household and marry Fitz.\n\nUnfortunately, historic events conspire to make the young couple's life one of continued want and anxiety. Fitz's involvement with the union frequently keeps him out of work, when he and his fellow workers go out on strikes. And once he works his way up to being foreman of the foundry, he's suddenly caught between the obligations of his new job (and to his employers), and with his union brothers who expect him to walk out with him. \n\nThe other main story of Strumpet City involves the difficult path of Father O'Connor (Frank Grimes), a snobbish Catholic priest who, in a misguided attempt to ease his conscience, leaves his wealthy parish to work among Dublin's most wretched tenement houses. Utterly unsuited to work among the poor (for whom he has a barely concealed disgust), Father O'Connor is greeted with open scorn by his superior, Father Giffley (Cyril Cusack), a troubled alcoholic who has spent too much time among the poor -- the poor who can't be helped with spiritual guidance alone. \n\nFather O'Connor's friend, Protestant businessman Mr. Yearling (Denys Hawthorne), frequently challenges O'Connor on his beliefs and where his sympathies lie - which is almost always with the factory owners and with the well-to-do.", "rating"=>10.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/203951-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Drama", "Mini-Series"]}

{"title"=>"The American President", "overview"=>"THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, the first documentary series ever to profile all 41 of America's chief executives, will premiere Sunday, April 9, 2000, 9-11 PM (ET) (check local listings) on PBS, with A MATTER OF DESTINY, featuring the programs entitled FAMILY TIES and HAPPENSTANCE. The epic series, ten hours in length, tells the story of the nation from the perspective of the highest office in the land, and features exclusive interviews with President Clinton and all the living former presidents except Ronald Reagan. The programs air in nightly two-hour blocks, concluding on Thursday, April 13.\n\nIn a unique casting coup, the series producers have persuaded an extraordinary group of political, military, and media figures to provide voices for the presidents who held office before the development of sound recording. The list includes General Colin Powell, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Senator Robert Dole, Walter Cronkite, radio personality Don Imus, former WASHINGTON POST editor Ben Bradlee, Senator John Glenn, James Carville, Andrew Young, and the Reverend Billy Graham.\n\nTHE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is narrated by TIME magazine's White House correspondent for four decades, Hugh Sidey. The series benefitted from an illustrious group of presidential scholars, but only one is seen on the screen: Richard E. Neustadt of Harvard University, whom Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has called \"our most brilliant commentator on the presidency.\"\n\n\"The story of the presidency is history on a scale that is both heroic and personal,\" says producer Philip B. Kunhardt III. \"These men achieved the highest office in the land -- whether through personal ambition, the turn of events, or sheer happenstance -- and imprinted their images on a chapter of the American story. Many of them were men of extraordinary character and many of them were flawed. One of the most interesting things that emerges when you look at them as individuals is that personal flaws are not necessarily a barrier to greatness, and rigorous personal virtue does not necessarily protect against failure.\"\n\nEach of the series' one-hour programs presents the stories of several presidents, linked by a common theme. The first evening's programs, FAMILY TIES and HAPPENSTANCE, for example, are presented under the umbrella title A MATTER OF DESTINY. FAMILY TIES investigates the fact that power and influence, even in a democracy, are handed down from generation to generation in a few privileged families. Profiled are John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy. HAPPENSTANCE explores the careers of five presidents -- John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, and Harry Truman -- who moved from the vice presidency to the White House upon the death of the president.\n\nFollowing the premiere on Sunday, April 9, POLITICS AND THE PRESIDENCY, featuring AN INDEPENDENT CAST OF MIND and THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN airs April 10. EXECUTIVE VISION, combining THE AMERICAN WAY and THE WORLD STAGE airs April 11. THE CANDIDATE, presenting THE HEROIC POSTURE and COMPROMISE CHOICES airs April 12. The series concludes with AN OFFICE AND ITS POWERS, featuring EXPANDING POWER AND THE BALANCE OF POWER on April 13.

The remains will be submitted to a barrage of tests that will unlock one of the most comprehensive scientific snapshots of Pompeian life ever produced - and there are some big surprises in store.\nUsing the latest forensic techniques it is now possible to determine what those who perished in the disaster ate and drank, where they came from, what diseases they suffered, how rich they were, and perhaps, even more astonishingly, the details of their sex lives.\nThe way the remains were found in the cellar already provides an invaluable clue about the lives of the people they belonged to. On one side of the room were individuals buried with one of the most stunning hauls of gold, jewellery and coins ever found in Pompeii. On the other, were people buried with nothing.

He figured that light from a distant star, as it passes right next to the sun and the sun’s gravitational field, will be bent. And the only way to see that would be to photograph a total solar eclipse. Fiercely competitive astronomers raced each other to exotic locations to see if Einstein was right... or wrong.

{"title"=>"Beyond Scared Straight", "overview"=>"Beyond Scared Straight is a new series executive produced by Arnold Shapiro and based on his Academy Award and multiple Emmy-Winning documentary \"Scared Straight!,\" that will profile unique approaches to juvenile crime prevention in prisons around the U.S.\n\n\"Scared Straight!\" has become an iconic name and a cultural phenomenon over the years. The film made a huge impact - showcasing the radical and effective juvenile intervention program that took place in a New Jersey prison. Since they were created, both the prison program and the film have turned countless kids away from drugs, violence and crime. The power of the original \"Scared Straight!\" program has inspired dozens of inmate-run intervention programs in men's and women's prisons across the country; and this series will showcase several of them. Under the auspices of Arnold Shapiro, \"Beyond Scared Straight\" profiles the new approach to keeping today's kids from becoming tomorrow's convicts.\n\nMuch like the original version of \"Scared Straight!,\" these youthful offender programs put boys and girls of all ethnicities, ranging in age from 13-18, into intensive one-day in-prison sessions that show them the realities of life behind bars. However, in many dramatic ways, these 21st Century programs are very different from the original because today's youth needs a different approach. For current teens, city streets can be as dangerous as the life they believe exists behind bars. TV, film and music have glorified the gang and prison experience and the task of \"scaring\" teens is more complicated now than ever. As a result, inmates have had to adapt their methods - making them more a combination of intimidation, information and communication - and the results for the new program have proven to be equally effective.\n\nEach 60-minute episode of \"Beyond Scared Straight\" will focus on a different prison program in the U.S., following 4 -5 at-risk teens.

{"title"=>"The Flockton Flyer", "overview"=>"After being evicted from the family car-repair business, the Carters get involved in the re-opening and running of the Flockton to Lane End railway, an old branch line that's been disused for years. The star of the show is a vintage ex-Great Western locomotive called, for the series, \"The Flockton Flyer\".\n\nAfter the eviction, the Carters set up home in Flockton Station, meeting up with a tramp by the name of Bill Jelly, who's been living in a track-side hut. Before being allowed to move in to the station, Bob Carter makes an agreement with Commander Frost (Chairman of the railway re-opening society) that he'll get the engine and the track ready for re-opening. Some of the locals are not happy about the re-opening plans, and there's a falling-out with farmer Joe Pratt, and vandalism to be dealt with too. One adventure involves a train robbery, where \"The Flyer\" is used to trap the crooks until the local police can be summoned. In the final episode of series 1, all's ready for the opening day, complete with band, bunting and cakes, but \"The Flyer\" goes missing! \n\nThe second series (by when the Carters have moved out to Crowcombe, because Flockton Station is now in use) involves an argument with local landowner, The Duke of Flockton, resolved by a memorable race between \"The Flockton Flyer\" and the Duke's locomotive. Later episodes concern the visit of a film crew to the Flockton line, cattle rustling, a dispute with the local fox hunters, the running away of Jessica, the younger Carter daughter, and finally a story about the Carters helping a group of travelling families to find a home after they'd been made unwelcome elsewhere.\n\nMuch of the filming was done on the West Somerset Railway, set in the glorious countryside between the Quantock Hills and Exmoor. The resulting images are memorable for their high visual quality.

{"title"=>"Great Thinkers, Great Theorems", "overview"=>"Mathematics is filled with beautiful theorems that are as breathtaking as the most celebrated works of art, literature, or music. They are the Mona Lisas, Hamlets, and Fifth Symphonys of the field—landmark achievements that repay endless study and that are the work of geniuses as fascinating as Leonardo, Shakespeare, and Beethoven. Here is a sample:\n\nPythagorean theorem: Although he didn't discover the Pythagorean theorem about a remarkable property of right triangles, the Greek mathematician Euclid devised an ingenious proof that is a mathematical masterpiece. Plus, it's beautiful to look at!\nArea of a circle: The formula for the area of a circle, A = π r2, was deduced in a marvelous chain of reasoning by the Greek thinker Archimedes. His argument relied on the clever tactic of proof by contradiction not once, but twice.\nBasel problem: The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler won his reputation in the early 1700s by evaluating an infinite series that had stumped the best mathematical minds for a generation. The solution was delightfully simple; the path to it, bewilderingly complex.\nLarger infinities: In the late 1800s, the German mathematician Georg Cantor blazed the trail into the \"transfinite\" by proving that some infinite sets are bigger than others, thereby opening a strange new realm of mathematics.\nYou can savor these results and many more in Great Thinkers, Great Theorems, 24 half-hour lectures that conduct you through more than 3,000 years of beautiful mathematics, telling the story of the growth of the field through a carefully chosen selection of its most awe-inspiring theorems.\n\nApproaching great theorems the way an art course approaches great works of art, the course opens your mind to new levels of math appreciation. And it requires no more than a grasp of high school mathematics, although it will delight mathematicians of all abilities.\n\nYour guide on this lavishly illustrated tour, which features detailed graphics walking you through every step of every proof, is Professor William Dunham of Muhlenberg College, an award-winning teacher who has developed an artist's eye for conveying the essence of a mathematical idea. Through his enthusiasm for brilliant strategies, novel tactics, and other hallmarks of great theorems, you learn how mathematicians think and what they mean by \"beauty\" in their work. As added enrichment, the course guidebook has supplementary questions and problems that allow you to go deeper into the ideas behind the theorems.\n\nAn Innovative Approach to Mathematics\n\nProfessor Dunham has been taking this innovative approach to mathematics for over a quarter-century—in the classroom and in his popular books. With Great Thinkers, Great Theorems you get to watch him bring this subject to life in stimulating lectures that combine history, biography, and, above all, theorems, presented as a series of intellectual adventures that have built mathematics into the powerful tool of analysis and understanding that it is today.\n\nIn the arts, a great masterpiece can transform a genre; think of Claude Monet's 1872 canvas Impression, Sunrise, which gave the name to the Impressionist movement and revolutionized painting. The same is true in mathematics, with the difference that the revolution is permanent. Once a theorem has been established, it is true forever; it never goes out of style. Therefore the great theorems of the past are as fresh and impressive today as on the day they were first proved.\n\nWhat Makes a Theorem Great?\n\nA theorem is a mathematical proposition backed by a rigorous chain of reasoning, called a proof, that shows it is indisputably true. As for greatness, Professor Dunham believes the defining qualities of a great theorem are elegance and surprise, exemplified by these cases:\n\nElegance: Euclid has a beautifully simple way of showing that any finite collection of prime numbers can't be complete—that there is always at least one prime number left out, proving that the prime numbers are infinite. Dr. Dunham calls this one of the greatest proofs in all of mathematics.\nSurprise: Another Greek, Heron, devised a formula for triangular area that is so odd that it looks like it must be wrong. \"It's my favorite result from geometry just because it's so implausible,\" says Dr. Dunham, who shows how, 16 centuries later, Isaac Newton used algebra in an equally surprising route to the same result.\nGreat Thinkers, Great Theorems includes many lectures that are devoted to a single theorem. In these, Professor Dunham breaks the proof into manageable pieces so that you can follow it in detail. When you get to the Q.E.D.—the initials traditionally ending a proof, signaling quod erat demonstrandum (Latin for \"that which was to be demonstrated\")—you can step back and take in the masterpiece as a whole, just as you would with a painting in a museum.\n\nIn other lectures, you focus on the biographies of the mathematicians behind these masterpieces—geniuses who led eventful, eccentric, and sometimes tragic lives. For example:\n\nCardano: Perhaps the most bizarre mathematician who ever lived, the 16th-century Italian Gerolamo Cardano was a gambler, astrologer, papal physician, convicted heretic, and the first to publish the solution of cubic and quartic algebraic equations, which he did after a no-holds-barred competition with rival mathematicians.\nNewton and Leibniz: The battle over who invented calculus, the most important mathematical discovery since ancient times, pitted Isaac Newton—mathematician, astronomer, alchemist—against Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz— mathematician, philosopher, diplomat. Each believed the other was trying to steal the credit.\nEuler: The most inspirational story in the history of mathematics belongs to Leonhard Euler, whose astonishing output barely slowed down after he went blind in 1771. Like Beethoven, who composed some of his greatest music after going deaf, Euler was able to practice his art entirely in his head.\nCantor: While Vincent van Gogh was painting pioneering works of modern art in France in the late 1800s, Georg Cantor was laying the foundations for modern mathematics next door in Germany. Unappreciated at first, the two rebels even looked alike, and both suffered debilitating bouts of depression.\nDescribing a common reaction to the theorems produced by these great thinkers, Professor Dunham says his students often want to know where the breakthrough ideas came from: How did the mathematicians do it? The question defies analysis, he says. \"It's like asking: ‘Why did Shakespeare put the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet? What made him think of it?' Well, he was Shakespeare. This is what genius looks like!\" And by watching the lectures in Great Thinkers, Great Theorems, you will see what equivalent genius looks like in mathematics.\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nDr. William Dunham is the Truman Koehler Professor of Mathematics at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mathematics from The Ohio State University.\n\nBefore his current appointment at Muhlenberg, Dr. Dunham taught at Hanover College in Indiana, receiving teaching awards from both institutions as well as the Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching from the Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware Section of the Mathematical Association of America. He was a Visiting Professor at Ohio State and at Harvard University, where he was invited to teach an undergraduate course on the work of Leonhard Euler and to deliver the Clay Public Lecture in 2008.\n\nDr. Dunham's \"great theorems\" approach to teaching mathematics was fostered by a 1983 summer grant from the Lilly Endowment, which also led to his first book, Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics—a Book-of-the-Month Club selection that has been translated into five languages. Other books followed in addition to articles on mathematics and its history, earning him numerous awards from the Mathematical Association of America and other organizations. He has presented popular talks on mathematics throughout the United States and has appeared on the BBC and NPR's Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.", "rating"=>6.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/245301-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Special Interest"]}

They are hungry, committed, idealistic and hard-working, but their lives away from the office are riddled with aspirations, explorations, fragile relationships and partying. \n\n<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/crownies/\">http://www.abc.net.au/tv/crownies</a>", "rating"=>7.3, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/249811-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Drama"]}

Famous Food will put this concept to the test by partnering with renowned restaurateurs, The Dolce Group, to give seven celebrities the chance to turn an empty Sunset Strip eatery into a flourishing and fully operating restaurant. If they succeed -- one of them will be rewarded with a partnership position in the new venture.\n \nThe cast includes Heidi Montag (\"The Hills\"), who sees this as her chance to save her family after the demise of her parent's restaurant. Singer (and the former NY Governor's Scandal-Girl) Ashley Dupre will try her hand at a new kind of business. She might not know food but she knows customer service.

Finally, Jake Pavelka who has been an airline pilot, a TV Bachelor, and a Dancing Star will now try his hand at the food business. For five weeks, this colorful crew of celebrities will roll up their sleeves and try to work together to launch their own restaurant.\n \nTo give them a fighting chance, Mike Malin and Lonnie Moore, founding members of The Dolce Group, will let them know what it takes to open a successful celebrity restaurant. From Hollywood and beyond, some of their well-known establishments include Dolce, Angels & Kings, Geisha House, Ten Pin Alley, rare 120, Wonderland and Johnny Smalls.

After they decide type of restaurant they want, they'll have to renovate the space; create marketing plans, craft a menu, hire the staff and eventually, ensure a flawless grand opening. They've got five weeks and a limited budget to get the restaurant up and running. If at the end of the time period, the restaurant is turning a profit, the Dolce Group will announce which of the Celebrities they've decided to keep as a partner in the restaurant. If not, the restaurant, and these celeb's dreams, will disappear for good.\n \nCan seven, famous, over-the-top personalities work together and make it in the culinary world?

{"title"=>"White Teeth", "overview"=>"Based on the best-selling and multi-award-winning novel by Zadie Smith, White Teeth is superbly adapted to the screen in this outstanding drama which features a compulsively watchable cast including Robert Bathurst, Phil Davis, Geraldine James, James McAvoy, Om Puri and more. Set in far from glamorous Willesden Green, London from the 1970s to the 1990s, White Teeth finds Archie Jones, interracially married to the post-Jehovah s Witness Clara, meeting up with an old colleague, Samad Iqbal who, with his family, has just arrived in England. The secrets they share from the past, and the secrets they will share in the future, are tossed and tumbled in a rich stew that bubbles with racial and sexual tension, new-found freedoms, old school politics, genetic science, animal liberation and the end of the world as we know it. It all adds up to a feast to be relished from start to finish.\n\nFirst broadcast on Channel 4 in 2002 and skillfully adapted by Simon Burke from the acclaimed novel by Zadie Smith, White Teeth is a colourful, decades-spanning chunk of recent history filtered through the lives of a small group of individuals.\n\nIt begins with unhappy war veteran Archie Jones (Phil Davis, Bleak House, Sherlock) preparing to end his life in Willesden, London, 1974. A man whose most important decisions rest on the toss of a coin, Archie’s doleful fatalism illustrates both White Teeth’s rich seam of bleak humour and its reliance on fate and coincidence to propel the plot.\n\nThe black comedy carries into the dialogue and the performances, as well as moments of absurd slapstick – watch out for Archie’s description of his first marriage, made all the funnier by Davis’ hangdog, deadpan performance. This exchange takes place during the first episode, in which he reconnects with an old army friend, Samad Iqbal (Om Puri, East is East, Charlie Wilson’s War).\n\nSamad, a blustering bon-vivant and pseudo intellectual, arrives in Willesden to fulfill an arranged marriage to a steely young bride (an eye-catching Archie Punjabi, East is East, The Good Wife). Samad finds England less welcoming than he’d hoped, as do Clara Bowden and her redoubtable mother.\n\nNaomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, 28 Days Later) imbues Clara with a combination of innocence and easy, instinctive sensuality, as she begins to leave her mother’s inflexible world view behind. Clara’s self-discovery leads her to a brief affair and an encounter with a commune, featuring a relatively subdued, but perfectly cast Russell Brand.\n\nIn one of a number of leaps back and forth through time, the second episode opens in 1984, which finds Samad and Archie neighbours with young families. Snubbed by his resentful wife, Samad allows himself to be led astray by a personable, dippy teacher at his sons’ school. The affair, deliberately the stuff of midlife crisis cliché, allows director Julian Jarrold to convey Samad’s conflicted state of mind with an assured touch, through acidly surreal fantasy sequences and Samad’s frequent entreaties to God.\n\nClever dialogue allows Archie to inadvertently cut through Samad’s self-justifying rhetoric with lugubrious common sense, but he lacks the conviction to prevent Samad from dividing his family to cover his shame.\n\nThe latter episodes focus on the consequences of Samad’s actions on the next generation, and apparently minor characters from the opening episodes are brought to the fore, including a fresh-faced James McAvoy (Shameless, The Last King of Scotland, Becoming Jane), as Josh, the bright, hot-housed only child of academic parents who befriends Samad and Archie’s children. Geraldine James and Robert Bathurst stop just shy of overplaying, in a bitingly satirical portrayal of well-meaning, ineffectual middle class parents who neglect Josh in favour of a more exotic houseguest.\n\n\nThe broiling resentments created by the elder generation in the opening episodes lead to a riotous climax in which all loose ends are firmly knotted in fantastic, if implausible fashion. Despite this, White Teeth is entertaining and witty enough to make stretching credulity to near breaking point not only forgivable, but an essential part of the story.\n\nThe latter episodes also reinforce the mythical and fantastic elements of the plot with visual cues—like Samad’s adolescent twins, one wears black, the other white, for much of the final episodes.\n\nwhite Teeth is  a timely piece, filled with committed and convincing turns from its cast. It neatly dissects the frictions of a multi-racial and multi-generational society, with a heartening lack of the present paranoia in TV drama, and maintains an affectionate, wonky sensibility.\n", "rating"=>0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/250833-1.jpg", "genres"=>[]}

{"title"=>"South", "overview"=>"South is a very personal offering from broadcast Marcus Lush.   South is a cardinal point on a compass and Southland has become a cardinal point in Lush's life. Moving to the region six years ago was a transformative process for him.\n\nWhile work introduced him to the area, the southern terrain, isolation and history, captured his imagination.  In this seven-part series Lush delivers personal perspectives on the grit, charm, and heart that makes up the fabric of the South.\n\nFrom the moment he leaves his home in Bluff, he is engaged in an epic adventure of land, air and sea, of innovation, evolution and conservation.  From Lush's sleepover at the Dog Island lighthouse and his discoveries of the lighthouse keepers and shipwrecks in our past through to sharing a Stewart Island tepee with Robin, a hippy who has set up a unique home stay and Tim Te Aika, who ran one of the most remote sheep farms in the country in Masons Bay, the characters and stories are the stuff great nations are built on.\n\nThere are remarkable discoveries on any journey but the South has kept its surprises well hidden, like Southlander Herbet Pither who may have been the first person in New Zealand and possibly the world, to fly and Peanut, the finder of this country's largest piece of space junk.  Lush also discovers a man called Ken Tustin who shares his thoughts on the possibilities of wild moose still living in Fiordland and he meets Kim Hollows, a chopper pilot who has been so overwhelmed by Fiordland's beauty, he risked everything to make a film about it.\n\nIt wouldn't be an exploration of the South and its epic terrain without testing a few personal limits.  Lush naturally walks the Milford Track and competes in the 99th annual Tuatapere Sports Day.  He tries his pioneering spirit on a bush-crashing trek from Waitutu Lodge to Puysegar Lighthouse. He also joins the Milford Wanderer on a rough ride around Preservation inlet, Dusky Sound and Doubtful Sound.\n\nSouth doesn't skirt around the more controversial points on the map.  Lush's visit to the Manapouri Dam where he talks to Tim Shadbolt about what it was like to work on the controversial scheme and he shares the story of Amy Bock, New Zealand's most infamous Con Woman fraudster, who posed as a man and married a woman at Nugget Point.\n\nAnd then of course there is the other star of the show, South itself.  The stunning scenery is nothing short of breathtaking - to be seen to be believed.\n\nThis series may be a thank you note from Lush but it could also be a nod from the rest of the country to an area that delivers more than its fair share of epic geography, pioneering spirit and good old fashioned heart.\n\n'South' is a very personal offering from broadcaster Marcus Lush, and in this spectacular, top rating series, he delivers personal perspectives on the grit, charm and heart that makes up the fabric of South.\n\nMarcus explores Southland & Otago -- its hidden majesty; almost unchartered waters; roads less travelled; and reticent characters in some of New Zealand's most inaccessible and remote parts of the country.\n\nBut it wouldn't be an exploration without testing a few personal limits, whether it was braving Foveaux Strait; canoeing down remote river gorges; or trekking into the wilds of Fiordland, Marcus was up for it! And then, of course, there is the other star of the show -- the South itself.

The original transmission was a watershed moment in Irish TV history, leading to an outcry and national debate about domestic violence. Family centres on the Spencers, a family living in a Dublin housing project. Charlo, played by Se n McGinley, is the abusive and cheating husband of Paula, played by Ger Ryan.

{"title"=>"The Littl' Bits", "overview"=>"The series describes the adventures of a race of tiny people (pixies) who live in a simple village in Foothill Forest. It focuses in particular on a group of children: Lillibit, Willibit, Snagglebit, Chip, and Browniebit. Snagglebit, the spoiled son of the mayor, is enamored of the beautiful Lillibit, but she's best friends with Willibit, the moral role model and main protagonist. Thus, even though they generally get along well, Willibit and Snagglebit often butt heads, especially over Lillibit. Snagglebit usually pals around with the short-in-stature Browniebit, who is something of a coward (and is often teased by Snagglebit for this), and Chip, who idolizes Lillibit's uncle, Dr. Snoozabit, and wants to be a doctor like him.\n\nAnother frequently recurring child character is Teenybit (Willibit's younger sister), who befriends Scarybit, an ill-tempered, superstitious old woman assumed to be a witch and shunned by most of the other villagers. Teenybit can see that, under Scarybit's tough exterior, she's just a lonely old lady who needs a friend.\n\nThe children are watched over by, and often scolded by, the older Littl' Bits including the doctor Dr. Snoozabit, the wood-cutter Chopabit, the baker Bakeabit, Willibit's father Grumpabit, Helpabit, the elder Elderbit, Mayor Bossabit (Snagglebit's father), and others. Snoozabit has a tendency to drink too much, forcing his young niece, Lillibit, to watch out for him and do her best to keep him on the right track (In the American version, Snoozabit's drunkenness was rewritten as being constantly sleepy and needing a nap, hence his English name).\n\nDr. Snoozabit has raised Lillibit since her infancy, and has always told her that her birth parents died shortly after she was born. Not having a mother and father around occasionally depressed Lillibit, especially when she observed her friends having fun with their parents. However, in the second-to-last episode of the series, it was revealed that Lillibit's parents were in fact alive and were \"Wanderbits\" (descendants of the \"Builderbit\" race who were exiled from Foothill Forest for how they treated the animals who rose up and nearly drove them to extinction). In the end, the villagers decided to allow them to stay in Foothill Forest, and Lillibit and her parents were joyously reunited - just in time for a devastating earthquake to ravage Foothill Forest in the final episode, forcing the villagers to band together to rebuild.\n\nWhen they're not involved in politics (for example, one episode in which they attempted to get their apathetic fellow villagers to vote on election day), the children spend much of their time exploring and interacting with the animals of the forest, both friendly and unfriendly, including raccoons, bears, bullfrogs, squirrels, fish, and horses. Lillibit can even speak directly with animals. They often take advantage of their animal friends for transportation, particularly Snuffly the flying squirrel and Blue the hedgehog.\n\nThe show espoused harmony between human beings and the animal kingdom. The plot in every episode of the show had an important lesson for the young audience - amongst the important issues which were addressed in the series, were responsibility, patience, prejudice, hard work and the value of family and friends.[2]", "rating"=>0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/251299-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Animation"]}

{"title"=>"The Lost Genius of British Art", "overview"=>"Has one of Britain's greatest artists been unfairly forgotten? Waldemar Januszczak thinks so. In this documentary, Januszczak argues that the little known 17th-century portrait painter William Dobson was the first English painter of genius.\nDobson's life and times are embedded in one of the most turbulent and significant epochs of British history - the English Civil War. As official court painter to Charles I, the tragic British king later beheaded by parliament, Dobson had a ringside seat to an period of intense drama and conflict. Based in Oxford, where the court was transferred after parliament took control of London, Dobson produced an astonishing number of high quality portraits of royalist supporters, heroes and cavaliers which Januszczak believes are the first true examples of British art. As he puts it in the film: 'Dobson's face should be on our banknotes. His name should be on all our lips.'\nThe film investigates the few known facts about William Dobson and seeks out the personal stories he left behind as it follows him through his tragically short career. When he died in 1646 - penniless, unemployed and a drunk - Dobson was just 36.\nAmong the Dobson fans interviewed in the film is Earl Spencer, brother of Princess Diana, who agrees wholeheartedly that William Dobson was the first great British painter.", "rating"=>0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/252113-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary", "Special Interest"]}

The voice-over throughout, usually the captain's, but sometimes a third person narrater's, is remarkable in its poeticism.\n\nThat such an languorous anti-spectacle was broadcast on television anywhere is mind boggling.

She wants to learn more about the Amish viewpoint and their reasons for wanting to keep their traditions alive.\n\nJoining them are 17-year-old Christian Hannah, who wants to see if meeting such a devoutly religious group will cement her faith - or make her question it. Media studies student Jordan wants to know what it'll be like without social media and music to occupy him 24/7.\n\nSeventeen-year-old James also loves listening to music and spends much of his day playing computer games. Since spending the last few years of his life in foster care, James now lives alone in a hostel in London. He says he never eats fresh fruit or vegetables and prefers take-aways: something unheard of to the Amish, who grow or catch all their own food.\n", "rating"=>0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/253893-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary", "Reality"]}

{"title"=>"Al Reinert - For All Mankind ", "overview"=>"In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy's challenge of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\". No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert's documentary For All Mankind is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences. Forty years after the first moon landing, it remains the most radical, visually dazzling work of cinema yet made about this earthshaking event.\n\nThe heroic, historic Apollo moon missions that put human beings on the moon are boiled down, expertly capsulated, and presented as one in Al Reinert's \"For All Mankind\". By editing together bits and pieces from the nine Apollo missions that were launched between 1968 and 1972 (as well as a few shots from later Gemini missions), director Al Reinert has fabricated a stirring and ultimately poignant saga of passion, perseverance, and power and remains one of the most engrossing documentaries of human endeavor and achievement ever committed to film. Criterion released the film years ago (it's #54 in their series), but this is a brand new high definition transfer. It is not to be missed.\nMuch of the footage in this compelling documentary has never before been seen, previous network television and film documentary seeming to dwell on the same few pieces of historic footage only. Thus, from the very start there is a freshness and vivacity to the imagery that's immediately captivating. To keep concentration fully focused on the images, there are no subtitles identifying the various astronauts or missions (though the Criterion disc does has a switch that the viewer can turn on to identify the persons on-screen if he wishes). And thus, the mission with its breathtakingly powerful launch, the fun in space, the snafus, the moon escapades (including some mishaps there as well which could have been life threatening), and the return trip are all captured in a variety of color and black and white footage that is simply amazing.\nReinert also doesn't use the talking heads approach to documentary filmmaking. The astronauts' voices are heard on the soundtrack describing their movements, their memories, their joys and fears during the flight, but there is never anything inserted to draw attention away from the film footage which, in the director's opinion, deserves to be seen without interruption. His decisions were certainly right on the money, too, because the film is as moving and impressive as it's possible for such a short, concise film to be. The achievement of reaching the moon in less than a decade after President Kennedy threw down the gauntlet in 1961 still seems unbelievable, and when one remembers all of the civil unrest that our country went through in the years leading up to Armstrong's unforgettable \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" declaration, the accomplishment today seems even more fantastic.", "rating"=>10.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/255224-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}

Army personnel were stationed at his studio and lived there for the duration of the war.  \n\nA military officer was actually based in Walt Disney’s office.

Most films meant for the public included some type of propaganda, while films for the troops included training and education about a given topic.\n\nFilms intended for the public were often meant to build morale. They allowed Americans to express their anger and frustration through ridicule and humor. Many films simply reflected the war culture and were pure entertainment. Others carried strong messages meant to arouse public involvement or set a public mood. Cartoons such as Bugs Bunny Bond Rally and Foney Fables pushed viewers to buy war bonds, while Scrap Happy Daffy encouraged the donation of scrap metal, and Disney's The Spirit of '43 implored viewers to pay their taxes.\n\nThe U.S. and Canadian governments also used animation for training and instructional purposes. The most elaborate training film produced, Stop That Tank!, was commissioned by the Canadian Directorate of Military Training and created by Walt Disney Studios.  Troops became familiar with Private Snafu and Lance Corporal Schmuckatelli. These fictional characters were used to give soldiers safety briefs and instructions on expected behavior, while often portraying behavior that which was not recommended.

{"title"=>"Mastering the Art", "overview"=>"Notorious art forger John Myatt teaches students the tricks of the trade. This part looks at David Hockney's iconic Californian pool paintings.\n\nThis exclusive ten-part Sky Arts series follows notorious art forger John Myatt, the man who was involved in what Scotland Yard called the biggest art fraud of the 20th Century, around the UK as he teaches aspiring artists how to paint in the style of the worlds greatest artists.\n\nMyatt's stunning forgeries of Matisse, Chagall and Klee notoriously fooled the art world in the 1990s. After seven successful years of gulling the world's most prominent private collectors and art experts, Myatt was eventually caught and charged with deception in 1998. He served time in Brixton prison but his subsequent fame has enabled him to open a legitimate Genuine Fake business where his replica paintings now sell for thousands of pounds and fine art publishers Washington Green have exhibited his work on a national tour. So high is the level of interest in his life story that Clive Owen is rumoured to play him in a forthcoming British film called what else? Genuine Fake.\n\nIn this revealing series, Myatt reveals the tricks of the trade and stylistic insights which enabled him to emulate iconic paintings from world-renowned artists. From a Monet landscape to a Modigliani nude, Myatt provides his aspiring students with both the theory and technique to set up their easels and capture the composition of a street scene by Hopper or the brushstrokes of a still life by Cezanne. And he passes on the tricks of the trade too - did you know that rubbing soil onto canvas replicates Braque's finish for example, or that coffee ages a painting by a century or more?\n", "rating"=>5.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/256861-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Special Interest"]}

While the audience didn't always follow his up-front delivery, fellow comedians were refreshed by his originality.[citation needed]\n\nAttell often begins a joke in a relatively tame way, but then gets progressively stranger and ends in an obscene non sequitur.

Along the way, Wei meets with and successfully woos seven beautiful women, climbs his way up the social ladder from brothel boy to great lord and nobleman, acquiring titles such as Imperial Emissary and Plenipotentiary, Ambassador, general and admiral - courtesy of Kangxi - as well as finding himself in positions completely at odds with the above: Green Wood Lodge Master of the Heaven and Earth Society, and White Dragon Marshal of the Mystic Dragon Cult.\nIn the end, however, Wei Xiaobao could not reconcile his two separate lives - as an anti-Qing rebel and Kangxi's devoted courtier. He chose to offer up his own life- in return for Kangxi's munificence towards him and also as an honourable way out of the Heaven and Earth Society. Pained and aggrieved beyond words, Kangxi orders the execution of his one and only true friend. Afterwards, plagued by loss and guilt, Kangxi took a long walk along the Great Wall, asking heaven for guidance - only to be happily surprised by the appearance of Wei Xiaobao, who didn't die after all. After saving his mate's life once again, Wei bades goodbye to Kangxi, reaffirming their friendship which will, from that point onwards, remain only in the minds and memories of the two men.", "rating"=>0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/258988-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Comedy", "Drama"]}

'You can capture the moment as one plant strangles another, and as they burst into flower. But whilst time-lapse photography allows you to see things that no human being has ever seen before, the added element of 3D takes the audience even further still.'\n\n'Stamens extend and burst to reveal their pollen grains in exquisite detail, and we can see close-up the incredible insects that partner up with these plants. The whole experience in 3D is just entrancing, and hypnotically beautiful.'\n\nFilmed over the course of a year at the Royal Botanic Gardens in West London, each of the three 50 minute episodes will cover a different area of plant life, from plant survival in wet and humid zones, scent and communication, and the continual adaptation of plants.", "rating"=>10.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/259418-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}

{"title"=>"Louisiana Lockdown", "overview"=>"Warden Burl Cain's \"Land of New Beginnings\" Offers Inmates \"Eight Seconds of Freedom\" in a Unique Animal Correctional Program -- \n\nWelcome inside the gates of Animal Planet groundbreaking new series - LOUISIANA LOCKDOWN, premiering Friday, June 1, at 10 PM ET/PT, set inside one of the country's largest maximum-security penitentiaries, Angola Prison. Angola is home to 5,300 prisoners who may never see the outside world again. With an army of 1,300 dedicated staff-people, the prison grounds are also home to hundreds of guards and workers and many of these families have dwelled there for generations. \n\nThe penitentiary has a bloodied past, known for the numerous grisly murders that occurred there, but Warden Burl Cain has since introduced correctional programs to correspond with his motto - \"Land of New Beginnings.\" The earned opportunity to be released temporarily from the prison walls to train animals outside in fresh air gives Angola inmates the incentive to work hard, stay in line and feel the reward of the closest thing to freedom many of them will ever experience again. \n\nThese dangerous criminals, with the harshest and most enduring prison sentences, have a simple choice: Either they rebel and live in despair or they cooperate and earn privileges at Angola. If they can earn the title of \"trustee,\" they are entrusted to do meaningful work, much of it with animals. It can take an inmate 10 years to reach trustee status and become eligible for the most sought-after jobs on the grounds, such as herding cattle, raising bloodhounds and training wild horses. Good behavior also earns the prisoners the chance to compete in Angola's controversial, yet popular annual rodeo where prisoners intermingle with the general public, work with horses and have the potential to earn prize money and acclaim. As one convict says, it's worth being good all year to have just \"eight seconds of freedom\" on the back of a bucking bronco. \n\n\"To the average person, the rodeo may seem non-traditional,\" says Cathy Fontenot, assistant warden of Angola Prison, \"but I have personally seen the transformation of these prisoners since we started moral rehabilitation and expanded on ideas like the rodeo and the trustee program - the improvement is phenomenal.\" \n\nOf course Warden Cain and his employees aren't naïve to the possibility of rebellion and escape. At any moment, they're prepared to protect themselves and society from acts of violence, using an army of guards and guard dogs as insurance. In the premiere episode of LOUISIANA LOCKDOWN, the threat of flooding (a likelihood as the prison is surrounded by water), can turn the prison into an escape route. With the Mississippi River nearing historic heights, the warden and his staff face their first-ever evacuation thus risking utter chaos by transporting hardened criminals to institutions across the state. \n\nLOUISIANA LOCKDOWN is a groundbreaking series, providing viewers with exclusive in-depth access to a prison with a fierce reputation and distinctive setup. Despite its numerous safeguards and extreme preparation for the worst-case scenario, Angola is not a place of extreme rigidity. It gives each inmate the control over his fate while serving his sentence and purpose behind working hard.

When it becomes clear that he is making a bid for another gold medal with another rower, Shelley is suddenly very keen to make her comeback.\nBut, although determined to regain her world champion fitness, Shelley quickly finds it’s not that easy.

{"title"=>"Turners Thames", "overview"=>"In this documentary, the presenter and art critic Matthew Collings explores how Turner, the artist of light, makes light the vehicle of feeling in his work, and how he found inspiration for that feeling in the waters of the River Thames.\n\nJMW Turner is the most famous of English landscape painters. Throughout a lifetime of travel, he returned time and again to paint and draw scenes of the Thames, the lifeblood of London. This documentary reveals the Thames in all its diverse glory, from its beauty in west London, to its heartland in the City of London and its former docks, out to the vast emptiness and drama of the Thames estuary near Margate.\n\nTurner was among the first to pioneer painting directly from nature, turning a boat into a floating studio from which he sketched the Thames. The river and his unique relationship with it had a powerful impact upon his use of materials, as he sought to find an equivalent in paint for the visual surprise and delight he found in the reality of its waters.\n\nBy pursuing this ever-changing tale of light, Turner also documented and reflected upon key moments in British history in the early 19th century; the Napoleonic wars, social unrest and the onset of the industrial revolution. His paintings of the river Thames communicate the fears and exultations of the time. \n\nTurner's greatness as a painter is often attributed to his modern use of colour. Many of his paintings are loved by the British public and regularly celebrated as the nation's greatest art. This film reveals for the first time on television a key inspiration for that modernity and celebrity; a stretch of water of immense importance to the nation in the early 19th century but which today is often taken for granted - the River Thames.", "rating"=>10.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/261281-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary"]}

Cinderella soon befriended four little friends who aided her whenever possible: Patch, a cute dog, Chuchu and Bingo, two clever little mice and a little bird named Pappy.\n\nDuring one of the few occasions when Cinderella is able to go into town (she is virtually segregated at home to cope with household chores, while her stepsisters are out having fun), she meets a strange young man who only identifies himself as a friend of Prince Charles.

But in the end, Cinderella discovers the true identity of the boy to whom she called a liar several times and is distraught and desperate; how will she make up for what she said to the Prince?\n\nMeanwhile, the King is organizing a big royal ball, to which all the unmarried girls of the area are invited, so that his son Charles can find a woman to marry. Even Cinderella was invited, but her stepmother tore up her invitation.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother, always ready to help Cinderella with her magic wand gives her a beautiful gown with the beautiful glass slippers: Cinderella can now go to the ball, but must return before midnight hour when the magic is completed.\n\nThis time, Cinderella is to be incognito at the ball; Prince Charles does not recognize that the beautiful princess who appeared out of nowhere was the companion of many adventures. But come midnight, Cinderella is forced to flee, losing a shoe on the staircase of the building. The Prince was fascinated by the mysterious girl, desperately searching house to house, to find her. It was proclaimed that the person who's feet fit into the shoe would become the bride of the Prince.\n\nAnd thus after many difficulties, Cinderella was proved to be that girl and was brought to the palace. On the day of the marriage, Duke Zaral had something else in mind. He gave poison to the Prince in his drink and kidnapped Cinderella. He took her to top of the Clock Tower and forced the King, Charles' father to give up his kingdom in lieu of Cinderella since his son was no more.\n\nSuddenly Prince Charles, who did not really die, appeared with the palace guards.

{"title"=>"The Voyage of Emperor Qian Long to Jiang Nan", "overview"=>"The story was set in the Qing Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Qian Long in 1740. It started off when Emperor Qian Long was young. At the time there was a cult (the Sun-moon cult) that wanted to revolt against him. It attempted to assassinate him and bombed the palace as well. Everyone was panicking, even the Empress Dowager and Empress. Zi Xia, who was the adopted daughter of the cult leader, fought with the Emperor in an attempt to kill him, but his bodyguard saved him. When she fought with another palace guard he unmasked her, and to everyone's surprise, she looked just like the Empress.\n\nThe assassination failed and the Emperor was very mad. He ordered for all his officials to find out about the cult and destroy them. He was so mad that he even scolded his beloved Empress. Out of all his wives and concubines I felt that he loved the Empress most, so that showed how mad he was. Later he found out that the Empress was pregnant and was extremely happy. He decided to go to Jiang Nan and promised her that he would take her as well. Then all of a sudden the Empress mysteriously died after she drank some medicine. The Emperor was again mad. He ordered for the doctor to be executed as he was the one who prescribed the medicine. He even ordered for the jailing of the 2 maids that served the Empress. The Emperor was gravely upset over his Empress' death and kept reminiscing about their past together. Shortly afterwards, he ordered for the release of the 2 maids. One of them had a flashback to the day the Empress died and held in her hands evidence against the murderer, so she was killed. The Emperor then got over his Empress' death and decided to continue with his idea of going to Jiang Nan.\n\nQian Long left the palace to go to Jiang Nan and he took with him a trustworthy and old minister, his bodyguard (Mao Yu Feng), and the other Empress's maid, Lian Er (Liu Wei). To disguise himself, he used the fake name, Gau Tin Sze. Along his travel to Jiang Nan, he met two other people and they joined him with his adventures. One of them was Xiao Yu (Yuki Hsu), and the other was Gu Zi Jie (Jia Yi Ping). They were the hilarious ones that made us laugh the most. The six of them experienced many things together. They went through a lot of things, such as Tin Sze being discovered as the Emperor, money shortage, being jailed and more. Zi Xia arrived at Bao-Ding Province in search for Gu Zi Jie, who was a Ming Dynasty nobleman hoping to rebel again. She rescued him and Tin Sze from the jail cell, and when Tin Sze saw Zi Xia, it was love at first sight, mostly because she looked like his dead Empress. He constantly tried to woo her, but she continually resisted, causing many funny scenes. There were also many other things that happened between his companions, but I didn't understand much of what happened, so I won't go into much detail as compared to the relationship between Tin Sze and Zi Xia.\n\nZi Xia started to develop feelings for Tin Sze as well. Both were oblivious to one another's identities. Some members of the cult knew Tin Sze's identity and wanted to kill him. He was hit by a poisonous weapon on the arm and was luckily saved by Zi Xia. He was badly hurt and because of the poison, he was very cold. Added with the rain and leaking roof, matters were worsened. In order to save him, Zi Xia used her body heat to keep him warm for the night. I don't think anything more happened though.\n\nAs the story progressed, more things happened in their relationship. Zi Xia's brother, Zhong Liang (Yang Chao), was madly in love with her and attempted to kill Tin Sze many times, but Zi Xia was always there to save him. There was also this one time when her father asked her to marry his son, and after much talk she agreed. However, things didn't turn out as planned; on the wedding day Zi Xia objected to getting changed and left. Love also blossomed between Lian Er and the bodyguard and with Xiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie. Soon after, Zi Xia's brother couldn't help it and told her that Gau Tin Sze was actually Emperor Qian Long (as he somehow found out). Zi Xia was very shocked and hurt about what she heard. She was very loyal to her father, and due to it, she agreed to act as an inside spy for him.\n\nThere was an attack where Tin Sze and the others were staying, and his bodyguard was killed, leaving Lian Er greatly heartbroken. Zi Xia found out about it and went to find them, hoping Tin Sze was ok. She reached the bodyguard's grave and saw Tin Sze there, all safe and sound, making her very relieved. Finally Tin Sze told her that he was the Emperor, oblivious to fact that she already knew. He took her into the palace and Lian Er served as her maid. Their relationship grew deeper. They broke through the many barriers in their way, including the Emperor's concubines, who were fighting for the position of Empress, since the Empress was dead. The only barrier that couldn't be broken was the fact that he was the Munchurian Emperor, and she was a Han, in a cult whose primary goal was to bring down the Qing Empire. Zi Xia was constantly reminded of who she was and who he was, causing great disturbance within her.\n\n\nThere were times when Zi Xia wanted to leave Qian Long, causing great pain between the couple. As the story neared the end, things start to get more complicated. Zi Xia was extremely frustrated with her situation. Turmoil built within her and to get rid of the pain, she drank. When she was drunk, she met with her brother, and he tried to rape her, taking advantage of the situation. However, to her luck, before he could do anything, Lian Er came in. Qian Long also arrived and fought off her brother. On that same night, Zi Xia cried to Qian Long about her worries, though not knowing about her brother's intentions, and spent the night with him. At night they were a loving couple, but by morning they were enemies again. The next morning Zi Xia woke and left the Emperor, making him extremely furious.\n\nZi Xia went back to her father, probably to say sorry as she did the wrong thing by sleeping with her enemy. She said something that greatly displeased him and he ordered for her to kill herself, even though he really didn't want to, as he had always treated her as his own daughter. To me, it seemed that she wanted to repay her father for her wrongdoings, as she picked up the sword that lay on the ground, preparing to kill herself. Her life was not to end that way. Just when she raised the sword to her neck, her brother flicked it out of her hand. He greatly loved her, and despite knowing she loved someone else, he still begged his father for her life. At that one scene, I think her father made her join in as part of the revolution, to kill Emperor Qian Long, the man she loved so deeply.\n\nThen there was to be an end to all the problems that arose, so the cult finally decided on a day for the revolution, which was set on the day of the Annual Fireworks. The members of the cult attempted to assassinate the Emperor; however, they still failed (as we should expect already). Qian Long brought with him a gun and his gun troops as well. Everyone was captured making him pleased, but things all turned around when a sword was placed to his neck. What made matters worse, was the person that held the sword was Zi Xia. They had a short talk and he told her that if she didn't kill him, he would kill her. Her love for him was very strong, making her drop the sword, saying she couldn't do it, even though knowing that she'd just dug her own grave by doing so.\n\nDue to Zi Xia's actions that occurred in front of so many people she had to be executed. Qian Long loved her so much that he didn't want her to die. He went to her jail cell and urged her to run away. He even pulled her out of the cell and pointed to the exit, telling her to run for it, but she refused. She didn't want to run as she wanted to repay him for all he had given her. I didn't understand what they said, but their acting must have been great, because I cried heaps.\n\nThe next scene was the day of the execution. Zi Xia stood on the podium, both her hands tied up to the poles. She stood there and had flashbacks about her and the Emperor. The time finally came; the judge threw the stick to the ground. The three of them (Zi Xia, Zhong Liang and their father) were untied and their heads were placed on the chopping board. Zi Xia watched painfully as her brother and father died right in front of her very eyes. It was then Zi Xia's turn. She had more flashbacks to her times with the Emperor as tears rolled down her eyes (and mine too). She looked to the audience and there the Emperor's minister and Gu Zi Jie were at the back, singing her a song. She took another glance elsewhere, and there she saw Tin Sze for the last time, and the executioner's sword came down towards her neck then, the screen blanked out. It is unclear whether she died or not.\n\n\nXiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie left the palace to live happily ever after, together. Two years later, Qian Long decided to visit Jiangnan again with Lian Er and the minister. He saw Xiao Yu and Gu Zi Jie, who had two children and were advertising something. It was a festival of some sort; there were fireworks and lion dancers. As he was enjoyably watching the lion dancers, one of them took off their head costume, and there, right in front of his eyes, stood Zi Xia. They stood face to face and as she smiled at him and he smiled back. However so, it is unclear whether or not it was Zi Xia, whether or not it was an illusion.", "rating"=>5.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/262860-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Documentary", "Drama"]}

{"title"=>"Kung Fu Master From Guangdong", "overview"=>"Kung Fu Master From Guangdong\" is a TV series from either a Taiwanese company, TVB, or a collaboration of both, starring Felix Wong Yut Wah, Leung Jay, and Lau Kam Ling. Felix Wong plays legendary hero, Wong Kei Ying, the father of the notorious Wong Fei Hong while Leung Jay plays Tin Wai Nam, his lover. Lau Kam Ling plays the daughter, Sung Yee Man, of a wealthy father, and is also in love with Wong Kei Ying. \"Kung\" is a series that suffers not only from a one-dimensional script that is now outdated, but also the dubbing of everyone's voices is quite a downside for those who are used to the original voices of the actors.\n\n\n\"Kung's\" story is cliche of old martial arts series where the main character usually holds morally and ideally rigid notions against corrupt government officials. Perhaps because there has been too many of those films recounting these stories, especially of Wong Fei Hong's and Wong Kei Ying's lives, out there that in order for \"Kung\" to succeed, it must provide fresh material--namely, tell the story in a different light. Instead, it chose a well-travelled path that sheds no viewieng value--a plot about one hero who has good martial skills and naturally uses it to do heroic deeds (without ever asking, \"why do heroic deeds?\" -- from Jin Yong in \"Heavenly Sword\"), to fend for the common people, fight off an evil cult (remember Jet Li's films?), and somehow attracts the interest of all the main female characters. The villains are also dramatically so bad that they deserve to die. Aside from plot failures, the impression one gets from the characters are not too ideal. While Felix Wong is a great actor, the role of the young Wong Kei Ying definitely does not fit him as it is strainingly obvious to the sight that Felix is getting old. His father, at most times, looks like he could be his older brother. Performances by Leung Jay and Lau Kam Ling are passable but seemed strained at times.\n\nThe fighting choreography though, is not bad and one might be appeased by some fight scenes. However, the ending of \"Kung\" is a gag. \"Kung\", at best, should have been a movie that should last only a few hours because the story was dragged out for the long run when it was certainly meant for the short, in terms of attention span.", "rating"=>6.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/262865-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Action and Adventure"]}

This particular edition can no longer be found in the archive (stolen by the Brothers themselves perhaps?) and is included here from a domestic recording.

It is Mark’s 21-year-old daughter, Madge Frettlby (Jessica De Gouw), who Whyte instantly sets his sights on, but Madge is already in love with Brian Fitzgerald (Oliver Ackland), a sensitive, hard-working Irishman.", "rating"=>7.0, "poster"=>"http://thetvdb.com/banners/posters/263719-1.jpg", "genres"=>["Drama"]}
